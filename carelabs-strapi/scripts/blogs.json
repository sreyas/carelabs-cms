Too often, equipment are allowed to run until it malfunctions and needs either serious repairs or replacement, which can cost a lot of money. There are ways you can prevent this. Organizing an electrical inspection is the best way to protect equipment from damage. Electrical thermography inspection is the process of photographing the exchange/loss of heat in machinery and facilities. It analyses electrical faults like loose connections and over loaded circuits</span>\n<h2><strong>Following are Benefits of Using Electrical Thermography Inspection</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It makes it possible to conduct electrical thermal imaging surveys with no intrusion.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It helps to reduce the number of costly and catastrophic equipment failures and unscheduled plant shutdowns</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can reduce typical visual examinations and tedious manual inspections and are especially effective in long-range detection situations.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can identify areas that are abnormally hot or cool</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reduce unscheduled downtime</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It assures </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">safety</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by detecting electrical problems in good time and avoiding fires caused by overloaded circuits or faulty wiring.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inspections using infrared thermography will help in detecting problems and allow for repairs. When equipment is fixed in good time, thus increasing equipment life, productivity will increase, and you will realize significant financial savings.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you can deal with electrical problems, all your systems will operate optimally. This will allow you to deliver quality products, a factor that will not only earn you trust but also boost your business.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Compared to manual inspections, infrared thermography will not require you to interrupt services during the inspection. This will reduce losses and improve your cash flow. In case you have commercial insurance that protects against interruptions, you will pay lower premiums for the coverage.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>How Electrical Thermography Inspection is Performed?</strong></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For electrical systems, infrared instruments are generally used to identify current-carrying conductor anomalies. Over time, connections become loose from cycling temperature variations due to loading fluctuations and vibration associated with electrical equipment operation along with many other factors. Higher resistances occur across these problem connections, and heat is created based on the associated losses. Heat is indirectly measured by the objects emissivity using the infrared instrument</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Electrical thermal inspection is done using a thermal imaging camera. The camera is pointed at the electrical panel, or electrical circuit you need. The screen on the equipment shows if there are any hot spots in the circuits. It also shows the temperature. The laser pointer shows the exact location where the temperature is higher than other. Then we can remove the panel and inspect. Qualitative inspection focuses on temperature differences as opposed to actual temperature</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loose connections, corrosions and load imbalances etc are resistive to the flow of electrons and cause connections or circuits to heat up. This is the energy you are paying for but getting no value from.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Following are few of the equipment we provide electrical infrared thermography inspection services</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Switch Gear</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transformers</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Service Disconnects</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transfer Switches</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bus Runs</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Motors / Pumps / Bearings</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lighting / Heating Contactors</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Motor Control Centers</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breaker Panels</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Starters</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">UPS Equipment</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chillers and Roof Top HVAC Equipment</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VFDs</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NFPA 70B, Recommended Practice for Electrical Equipment Maintenance, published by the NFPA, provides a listing of maintenance and equipment testing intervals in Annex I. Businesses with high electrical demands should have a thermographic scan performed at least annually on critical systems, such as circuit panels, switchgears, and transformers. Based on the scan results, a schedule to rescan should be based on the types of equipment, power consumption, and age of the electrical systems. A qualified electrician can assist the property owner in determining what and how often to conduct scans. However it is recommended to do the inspections within a year to detect faulty system on new installations</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because thermographic imaging equipment is complex, persons performing evaluations require special training. In addition, there is potential exposure to “live” electrical components. As such, unless the company is large or sophisticated, these inspections are commonly performed by consultants.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the typical application thermography is also used for the following inspections</span>\n<h3><b>Transformers </b></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Infrared imaging of the transformer can often detect fluid levels and radiator convection cooling problems</span>\n<h3><b>Switchgear </b></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The integrity of outdoor switchgear assemblies is often compromised by defective strip heaters. The strip heaters temperature changes increase the switchgear temperature slightly above ambient in order to prevent condensation during daily or seasonal. The functionality of these strip heaters and their effectiveness to perform this duty can be determined by performing thermal imaging of the switchgear enclosures</span>\n<h3><b>Low Voltage Duct</b></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Low-voltage bus duct assemblies are popular for facility applications that require distributing high currents for long distances due to their lower installation cost compared to conduit and cable. Although very reliable, these assemblies are very difficult to test by conventional methods due to limited access caused by their construction. Infrared inspections are one of the few technologies that can help identify bus segment contact problems at joints. Infrared inspections must generally be performed by scanning the outside bus duct enclosure. Although significant air gaps exist between the bus and enclosure, this technique has been successful in detecting connection problems.</span>\n<h3><b>Noncurrent-carrying Items</b></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many times a metallic structural support, cableway, or cable tray assembly, none of which should be carrying current will indicate heating that is apparently from electrical current flowing. Field measurements of hundreds of amperes have been seen numerous times and are most commonly the result of excessive eddy currents caused by inductive heating. This heating effect can cause the surface temperature to rise well beyond the boiling point of water, potentially presenting a burn hazard to personnel or the deterioration of other substances in close proximity.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The infrared survey is a great detection tool for potential problems, but bonus electrical tests should be performed in order to confirm faults in the circuit. It is really easy to have a positive thermal image. Therefore, other measurements such as current readings, harmonic analysis, power factor, should be performed for clarification. These additional tests are mandatory as certifiable test results may be required for analytical purposes.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, the infrared survey remains one of the best overall tools for detecting potential electrical problems. The popularity of the technology and the low cost of equipment have allowed non-experts to implement infrared survey programs. However, the additional cost associated with upper-end equipment and experienced technicians with certified training may very well be worth every penny when important decisions are made based upon infrared survey result.</span>",

During the late 70s and early 80s, a time when fuel prices rose dramatically, thermography was embraced widely as a tool to help determine building performance. The ability to professionally test and evaluate the performance of a building’s envelope is quickly becoming essential for the proper management of today’s commercial and institutional structures.</span>\n<h2><b>Several Factors that Necessitate Building Envelope Inspection</b></h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Proliferating government regulations</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New construction techniques and materials</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rising energy costs</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Growing concerns about occupant health, and escalating litigation</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moisture damage, frozen pipes,</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High heating costs</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Infrared thermography is the only proven non-destructive method for identifying moisture and energy loss.  Discovering deficient areas within your facilities, reduce operating costs, and create more efficient building maintenance practices and reduce greenhouse emissions.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An appreciable amount of money can be saved by building owners &amp; operators through the correct application and use of Infrared Thermography Building Envelope Inspections. Timely investment in an Infrared Building Envelope Performance Survey can ensure the structural integrity and safety of commercial or industrial buildings.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It can also serve as a quality control tool, to ensure that insulation has been installed correctly.</span>\n\n<strong>Building envelope inspection is done at:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Homes because it instantly shows where your heat loss is occurring in a detailed visual image to assist in achieving a comfortable living environment and reduce energy costs.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Commercial buildings because Some client specifications of buildings over 500M2 request infrared thermography in order to assess their building integrity alongside an air permeability test.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>How is Building Envelope Infrared Thermography Inspection done?</b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heat losses from buildings are accelerated by structural problems, poor construction practices, missing or inadequate insulation, moisture infiltration and air leakage.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thermography measures surface temperatures by using infrared video and still cameras. These equipments see light that is in the heat spectrum. Images on the video record the temperature variations of the building's skin, ranging from white for warm regions to black for cooler areas. The resulting images help us determine whether insulation is needed or not. They also serve as a quality control tool, to ensure that insulation has been installed correctly.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A thermographic inspection is either an interior or exterior survey. The energy auditor decides which method would give the best results under certain weather conditions. Interior scans are more common, because warm air escaping from a building does not always move through the walls in a straight line. Heat loss detected in one area of the outside wall might originate at some other location on the inside of the wall. </span>\n\n<strong>Following are the deficiencies that can be found in a building envelope thermography inspection.</strong>\n<h2><strong>Moisture Intrusion or Condensation</strong></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virtually all of the thermal envelope deficiencies identified by thermographic testing involve the conduction of heat through building materials or the penetration and emanation of air through gaps in the building envelope. Conduction problems are often caused by leakage of exterior water into the building envelope, failure of piping systems, and condensation of moisture vapour within the structure. Moisture considerably reduces the R-value of building materials, resulting in a dramatic increase in the conduction of heat through moisture-damaged components. Other typical causes of conduction losses through the envelope include missing or improperly installed insulation and unintended thermal bridging of structural components.</span>\n<h2><strong>Exterior Insulation and Finishing Systems</strong></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The growing popularity of buildings using Exterior Insulation and Finish Systems has been accompanied by numerous cases of moisture-related structural damage. Water intrudes where sealing  have begun to fail. Moisture is then trapped under the skin. Thermography is an invaluable tool to locate moisture in EIFS systems. Inspections are best conducted in the early evening from the outside after a sunny day with little or no wind.</span>\n<h2><strong>Subsurface Heat Sources </strong></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heating coils are being used more and more either to keep outside walkways or entrance ramps snow free or to provide heat to areas and rooms via hot water or electric cables. Thermography provides a quick way to verify location and performance of these subsurface devices. Typically the thermal pattern shows up very clearly even when the heat source is embedded in several inches of concrete. Similarly, water pipes in wall sections can usually be located quite readily.</span>\n<h2><strong>Verification of Construction Detail</strong></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thermography is being used with great success to verify bond beams and placement of reinforcing in concrete masonry unit walls. The solid portions of the wall change temperature more slowly than the rest. The inspection can be conducted anytime the wall is in a thermally transient condition, typically in the early evening as it cools down. Because the inspection is conducted during construction, deficiencies can be rectified prior to occupation with relatively minor inconvenience</span>\n<h2><strong>Roof Moisture Inspections </strong></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The inspection of flat roofs, especially built-up roofs has been proven for a number of years. The technique allows for the detection of moisture trapped in a roof system. Over the time this moisture leads to the pre-mature degradation of the roof. The moisture appears warmer at night after a sunny day due to its greater thermal capacitance.</span>\n<h2><b>Types of Building Thermographic Inspection Devices</b></h2>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The energy auditor may use one of several types of infrared sensing devices in an on-site inspection</span></h4>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A spot radiometer (point radiometer):</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It measures radiation one spot at a time, with a simple meter reading showing the temperature of a given spot. The auditor pans the area with the device and notes the differences in temperature.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thermal line scanner :</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It shows radiant temperature viewed along a line. The thermogram shows the line scan superimposed over a picture of the panned area. This process shows temperature variations along the line.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thermal imaging camera:</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It produces a 2-dimensional thermal picture of an area showing heat leakage. Spot radiometers and thermal line scanners do not provide the necessary detail for a complete home energy assessment.</span>\n<h2><b>Qualification of a Thermographer for Building Envelope Thermographic Inspection</b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building envelope thermography inspection requires qualified personnel with related experience. Both training and experience are essential. An intimate knowledge of construction techniques, practices, materials, and failures is also important. It is also not unusual for the thermographer to work with other building scientists who have expertise in other areas. Failure to conduct an inspection in a professional manner can result in serious damage to the building and to the occupants.</span>",

        "content": "Infrared thermography is a test that can be utilised to identify unbalanced loads, poor connections, deteriorated insulation or any other issues in energized electrical panels or components without dismantling the components. These problems may lead to excess power use, increased maintenance costs, or catastrophic equipment failure resulting in unscheduled service interruptions, equipment damage, or other problems.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Why is Thermography Testing of Electrical Panel Important?</h2>\nThe NFPA or National Fire Protection Association assesses that 10% of the fires happening are associated with electrical system failures, like failure of terminals, electrical insulation and related components. Electricity at Work Regulations Act 1989, Health &amp; Safety at Work Act 1974 and BS 7671 (IEE Wiring Regulations 17th Edition as amended) suggest that electrical infrastructure be regularly maintained and tested to ensure compliance with safety guidelines.\n\nPerforming an infrared testing will highlight problems with electrical infrastructure under load during the testing process as these areas will manifest as anomalous temperatures shown in the live image on the thermal imaging camera. Moreover, failures can result in employees to be bared to live electrical circuits, making them prone to severe injury or death from electrocution. By detecting high-resistance connections and repairing them, the likelihood of a breakdown of the electrical wires and related components will be reduced.\n\nOther benefits of finding and fixing these faults are the cost effectiveness that comes from energy conservation and reduction in shutdown and repair charge. High resistance in circuits causes an increase in current flow. When current flow is increased, the resulting power consumption will increase. Additionally, large current draw can lead to severe electrical circuit components, like circuit breakers, fuses and transformers, to collapse prematurely. These failures result in higher maintenance and repair costs, and resultant business interruptions.\n\n<strong> </strong>\n<h2>Benefits of Doing Thermography Testing of Electrical Panel</h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Determines if the components and system have been properly installed and are not damaged</li>\n \t<li>Reduces downtime</li>\n \t<li>Reduces risk of equipment failure</li>\n \t<li>Increases safety</li>\n \t<li>Improves insurability</li>\n \t<li>Reduces liability exposure of the designers and installers</li>\n \t<li>Improves system performance</li>\n \t<li>Determines whether components and systems operate properly and meet the design intent</li>\n \t<li>Determines if components and systems are in compliance with the project specifications and design</li>\n \t<li>Reduces construction schedule delays</li>\n \t<li>Saves money</li>\n</ul>\n<strong> </strong>\n<h2>What is Performed During Infrared Thermography Testing of Electrical Panels?</h2>\nElectrical switchgear and panels are the bloodline to supply electricity throughout commercial, manufacturing and industrial buildings. Without it, production stops and money are lost. Infrared is a proven tool to identify electrical problems prior to failure, allowing our clients to take proactive steps to prevent costly and sometimes dangerous electrical outages.\n\nInfrared thermography testing is a way of examining electrical components by attaining heat distribution images. This testing method is based on the fact that most components in a system show an increase in temperature when malfunctioning. The increase in temperature in an electrical circuit could be due to lose connections or a worn bearing in the case of mechanical equipment. By observing the heat patterns in operational system components, faults can be located and their seriousness evaluated.\n\nCarelabs has numerous years of experience performing thermography testing of electrical panels in UAE for commercial, industrial, manufacturing facilities, college and universities, power generation plants, overhead power-lines, utility sub stations, maritime vessels, water treatment facilities, churches, data centers, medical facilities, hospitals and more. Carelabs have the experience and skill needed to precisely detect and record a wide range of electoral issues occurring in electrical systems.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>How is Thermography Testing of Electrical Panels Done?</h2>\nThe testing device utilised by inspector is an infrared camera or a thermal imager. These devices measure the natural emissions of infrared radiation from a heated object and produce a thermal picture. Modern Thermal Imagers are portable with easily operated controls. As direct contact with the system isn’t needed, testing can be done under completely energized state leading to no loss of production or downtime.\n<h3>Thermal testing can identify following factors:</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>High resistance connections</li>\n \t<li>Hot spots</li>\n \t<li>Over loaded cables</li>\n \t<li>Over loaded fuses or breakers</li>\n \t<li>Imminent motor or conveyor bearing failure</li>\n \t<li>Motor windings over heating</li>\n \t<li>Overheating in distribution equipment</li>\n \t<li>Phase load imbalance</li>\n \t<li>Hot spots in high level lighting (easily scanned from the floor)</li>\n \t<li>Heat build-up in overcrowded trunking</li>\n \t<li>Thermal insulation breakdown (hot or cold)</li>\n \t<li>Thermal loss</li>\n \t<li>Damp ingress</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Following are the Procedure for Thermography Testing of Electrical Panels</h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Panel to be tested shall be energized and under adequate load; ideally this is normal operating load.</li>\n \t<li>Subject panel shall be externally examined before opening or removing any protective covers to determine the possible presence of unsafe conditions. If unusual heating or dangerous conditions exists, a qualified assistant must take suitable corrective steps before starting the infrared testing.</li>\n \t<li>Electrical panel enclosures shall be opened to provide line-of-sight access to components contained therein. In some cases, further disassembly may be required to allow for a complete infrared testing.</li>\n \t<li>Steps should be taken to make sure that the subject panel can be sufficiently and fully imaged.</li>\n \t<li>Infrared testing may be qualitative or quantitative in nature.</li>\n \t<li>While carrying out qualitative testing, the thermographer must use a thermal imager, unlike an imaging radiometer used in case of quantitative testing, with resolution adequate to offer clear image of the tested panels.</li>\n \t<li>When carrying out IR testing, the thermographer must take maximum effort to make sure the precision of non-contact temperature readings.</li>\n \t<li>If possible, alike components under alike load must be compared to each other.</li>\n \t<li>Components showing abnormal operating temperatures or thermal patterns must be considered as exclusions and reported with a thermal image or thermogram and visible light image.</li>\n \t<li>Thermal figures must be saved on appropriately. Maximum effort must be taken to make sure the thermal picture is in focus.</li>\n \t<li>Visible light pictures images must be captured with a daylight camera essential to the infrared imager.</li>\n \t<li>Visible light pictures must be correctly visible to make sure appropriate detail can be obtained.</li>\n \t<li>Particular attention should be given to perspective, focus, contrast, resolution, and lighting.</li>\n \t<li>Both thermal and visible images must be incorporated in the report.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Documentation or Report Preparation</h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>The distance from the infrared imager to the exception.</li>\n \t<li>Whenever possible, the maximum rated load of the exception and its measured load at the time of the testing.</li>\n \t<li>The reflected temperature, emittance and transmittance values needed to find the temperature of the faulty component.</li>\n \t<li>When considering absolute temperature, the surface temperature of the exception and the standard temperature referenced are taken into account.</li>\n \t<li>If desired, an evaluation of the temperature severity of the exception.</li>\n \t<li>If needed, a repair priority rating for the faulty component depending on its temperature severity rating.</li>\n</ul>",

        "content": "Infrared thermography is an advanced precautionary maintenance program for Electrical System. Thermography is ideal to see beyond what is visible to the naked eye.\n\nCarelabs offers thermography scan of all electrical systems to identify too hot or too cold areas. The primary application for infrared thermography is electrical applications. Thermal imaging is the method utilised for detecting and visualizing the electrical faults.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Why is Thermographic Testing of Electrical Equipment Important?</h2>\nAn electrical equipment is made up of complex electrical components. As these electrical components start to age their performance may start to deteriorate and, consequently, may display elevated temperatures which, if left undetected, may result in a catastrophic fire event. Most fires in UAE are an outcome of this negligence.\n\nFurther, as an electrical system is altered, updated and undergoes inspection &amp; testing, another defects manifest which include:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Connection issues</li>\n \t<li>Overloading</li>\n \t<li>Misbalancing</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nUtilising state of-the-art thermal imaging equipment you can determine whether temperatures of electrical components are\n<ul>\n \t<li>Healthy</li>\n \t<li>Deteriorating</li>\n \t<li>At dangerous levels</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\nNot only is it an effective method of detecting potential issues, it also serves to minimise any catastrophic electrical accidents.\n\nUltimately, an electrical thermographic survey is all about bringing peace of mind to those responsible for the health and safety of your organisation.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Benefits of Thermography Testing of Electrical Equipment</h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Prevent electrical failures before they happen</li>\n \t<li>It’s cheaper to make any repairs before they reach the point of no return</li>\n \t<li>You’ll use less energy</li>\n \t<li>No unexpected downtime (Normal business hours maintained)</li>\n \t<li>Your electrical system will last longer</li>\n \t<li>Your electrical service won’t face any interruption during the inspection</li>\n \t<li>Reduced Risk Factors</li>\n \t<li>Safer Work Environment</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<h2>What is Done During Thermographic Testing of Electrical Equipment?</h2>\nThe NFPA found out that 10% of the fires happening in properties are associated to electrical system failures, like failure of terminals, electrical insulation and related components. Article 130 of NFPA 70E, <em>Standard for Electrical Safety in the Workplace</em>, provides details on the level of protection required based on the arc flash potential present. Published by the NFPA, NFPA 70B, <em>Recommended Practice for Electrical Equipment Maintenance</em>, offers a listing of equipment testing and maintenance intervals in Annex L.\n\nNormal wear, vibration, chemical contamination, corrosion, fatigue, expansion and contraction associated with load and temperature changes and faulty assembly or installation may lower the conductivity or increase the resistance level of a connection or component. This increase in resistance will result in elevated temperatures of the electrical connection or mechanical component. These conditions often cannot be detected by the naked eye. Excessive heat and temperature rise can be readily measured and noted by an infrared camera. Increased temperatures indicate potential trouble spots that could lead to failure of the component. Any deficiencies noted should be rectified immediately by a qualified electrician or mechanic.\n\nA company may perform thermographic inspections in-house or hire a consultant. Because thermographic imaging equipment is complex, persons performing evaluations require special training. In addition, there is a potential for exposure to “live” electrical components.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>Few of the Equipment that require Thermographic Testing are as Follows</h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Step-up or step-down power transformers onsite.</li>\n \t<li>Power transfer circuits, such as switchgears and relays.</li>\n \t<li>Modifications to electrical panels, power control boxes, and sub-panels.</li>\n \t<li>Buildings with aluminum wiring.</li>\n \t<li>Motor starter circuits.</li>\n \t<li>High torque and heavy current draw motors.</li>\n \t<li>Presence of equipment like mercury vapor lamps which are high output lighting equipment.</li>\n \t<li>Use of uninterruptible power supplies.</li>\n</ul>\nInfrared Thermography testing, commonly known as infrared scan, is an ideal technique for inspecting equipment for defective components or connections. Vibration, normal wear, corrosion, chemical contamination, expansion, fatigue and contraction associated with temperature and load variations and faulty assembly or installation may reduce the conductivity or boost the resistance level of a component. This increase in resistance will result in elevated temperatures of the electrical connection or mechanical component. These conditions often cannot be detected by the naked eye. Excessive heat can be readily noted and the temperature rise measured by an infrared camera. Increased temperatures indicate potential trouble spots that could lead to failure of the component. Any deficiencies noted should be rectified immediately by a qualified electrician or mechanic.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h2>How is Thermography Testing in Electrical Equipment Performed?</h2>\nThe infrared camera or thermogram is an important component to help maintain a viable and safe manufacturing operation. Infrared thermography can be a maintenance tool in many ways and there is no substitute to its accuracy, safety or reliability.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Prepare a plan and advise key personnel of the testing date and time to avoid any delays. The plan should include a general route outlining a starting point and progressing through the facility in an efficient manner. The goal is to prevent or minimize backtracking which will delay progress.</li>\n \t<li>Ensure a brief general meeting takes place beforehand to discuss the scope of the inspection and communicate all company safety requirements.</li>\n \t<li>Often, it’s required that the facility provide an electrical engineer or electrical engineer assistant who has good knowledge of the electrical distribution system. This person should be qualified in all company safety procedures and have experience in opening electrical cabinets or removing covers of the equipment to be inspected. Testing of mechanical equipment does not require an electrician; however, someone knowledgeable with the equipment and maintenance history is preferable.</li>\n \t<li>All equipment to be inspected must be under normal load and ready for inspection. Please note of any door switches with no override and alert personnel to ensure no accidental interruption of equipment operation occurs. Any door switches which cannot be bypassed must be outlined as part of the inspection plan.</li>\n \t<li>After testing is conducted, ensure an exit meeting takes place and discuss any critical recommendations which should be addressed immediately. At times a critical condition may exit that cannot wait until report is generated. Post Inspection</li>\n \t<li>Once report is submitted discuss findings with key personnel and develop a plan to address all recommendations or important items outlined in the report.</li>\n \t<li>Any questions concerning any portion of the report must be thoroughly discuss with company who performed the inspection to ensure no unnecessary work or repairs are perform and to ensure recommendations are satisfactorily completed.</li>\n \t<li>Document all work performed, repairs and/or replacement and archive in a secure location. Often the report provided by the company will include an area to document the steps taken to complete the recommendation, date completed, who performed the work and signature.</li>\n</ul>",
