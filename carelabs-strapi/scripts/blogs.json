        "content": "<em><strong>Carelabs is authorized provider of Electrical Installation's Study, Analysis, Inspection, and Certification services in UAE, and offer biomedical equipment safety testing and inspection services.</strong></em>\n\nBiomedical equipment (armamentarium) are equipment designed to aid in the diagnosis, monitoring or treatment of medical conditions. Achievements of biomedical equipment installation are significant improvement of health care in all medical specialties, reducing the number of seriously ill people, reduction of mortality. Biomedical equipment technology is used for diagnostic Imaging, radiographic and Fluoroscopic X-ray, diagnostic ultrasound, mammography physiological monitoring, and dental related procedures.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nBut unintended consequences occur due to causes like improper handling, insufficient or improper staff practice in handling with instruments, insufficient experience, like medical staff rarely read manuals for the users and equipment malfunctions.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n<h2><strong>Why We Need Biomedical Instrument Safety Inspection?</strong></h2>\n<strong>It helps in:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prolong the life-cycle of your equipment.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Protecting your patients, staff and assets.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Approval agencies, regulatory requirements &amp; insurance companies may require safety inspections &amp; testing</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quality assurance.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Asset management.</span></li>\n</ul>\nCarelabs perform biomedical inspection according to manufacturer’s, and regulatory agencies requirement.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With orderly, measurable, and appreciable methods Carelabs will assist your project and avoid the probability of equipment-related risks, reduce accidents and events, stay consistent with regulatory reporting requirements and limit equipment &amp; supply costs.</span>\n<h2><strong>How do We Conduct Biomedical Equipment Safety Inspection?</strong></h2>\nIt is suggested that biomedical inspections should be led by teams, with the lead Investigator being liable for the overall management of the inspection. Analysts (Chemists and/or Microbiologists), Computer Specialists, and Engineers can take part in all or portions of the inspection. Prior to the inspection, the \"team\" should discuss the duties of the particular team members.  <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:480,&quot;335559738&quot;:120,&quot;335559739&quot;:120,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nAs with any inspection, analysis is generally an audit and is not all inclusive. Thus, validation data for all systems, processes, controls and test procedures cannot be reviewed. However, specific detailed coverage should be given to a few systems or controls. A flow chart from the application document or from the firm should be obtained prior to or early in the inspection and the specific manufacturing steps should be reviewed with the manufacturer's responsible personnel.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:480,&quot;335559738&quot;:120,&quot;335559739&quot;:120,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nAn effective biomedical equipment inspection programme consists of adequate planning, management and implementation. Planning considers the financial, physical and human resources required to adequately implement the inspection. Once the programme has been defined, financial, personnel and operational aspects are continually examined and managed to ensure the programme continues uninterrupted and improves as necessary. Ultimately, proper implementation of the programme is key to ensuring optimal equipment functionality.\n<h2><strong>What Services are Provided in Biomedical Inspection?</strong></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to electrical compliance at all \"Patient Areas\" such as medical and dental practices. Following are few among the list of areas where biomedical equipment safety inspection should be conducted:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doctors consulting room</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chiropractic and physiotherapy treatment rooms</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dental surgeries</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CT rooms</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Treatment rooms</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultrasound rooms</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blood collection areas</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">X-ray rooms</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nursing</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Carelabs perform whole </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">inspection of medical facility in strict compliance with current laws and regulations using equipment and techniques approved by regulatory agencies, and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">complete initial inspections, take inventory of all assets, calibrate all equipment.</span>\n\n<strong> Biomedical instrument safety inspection include:</strong>\n<h3><strong>1. Visual Inspection</strong></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Visual inspection is a relatively easy procedure to make sure that the medical equipment in use still conforms to the specifications as released by the manufacturer and has not suffered from any external damage or contamination.</span>\n\n<strong>These include following inspections:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Housing Enclosure – Look for damage, cracks.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contamination – Look for obstruction of moving parts, connector pins.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cabling (supply, Applied Parts) – Look for cuts, wrong connections.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fuse rating – check correct values after replacement.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Markings and Labelling – check the integrity of safety markings.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Integrity of mechanical parts – check for an obstructions.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>2. Earth Bond Test</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earth Leakage: current flowing down the protective Earth conductor of the mains inlet lead.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enclosure Leakage: current flowing to Earth through a person by touching the medical equipment / system or part of.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Applied Part or Patient Leakage: current flowing through a person to Earth from the Applied Part or current flowing from a person to Earth via the Applied Part by applying unintended voltage from an external source.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>3. Earth Leakage Test</strong></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Earth Leakage Test shows the current flowing through or via the insulation of the Medical Device into the protective Earth conductor.</span>\n<h3><strong>4. Enclosure Leakage Test</strong></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enclosure Leakage displays the current that would flow if a person came into contact with the housing (or any accessible part not intended for treatment or care) of the Medical Device.</span>\n<h3><strong>5. Patient Leakage Current</strong></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Patient Leakage Current is the current flowing from the Applied Part via the patient to Earth or flowing from the patient via an Applied Part to Earth, which originates from an unintended voltage appearing on an external source.</span>\n<h3><strong>6. Documentation</strong></h3>\n<span class=\"TextRun SCXW192914746\" lang=\"EN-IN\" xml:lang=\"EN-IN\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW192914746\">The record for each device should include identifying data such as a brief description, manufacturer, mode</span></span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW192914746\" lang=\"EN-IN\" xml:lang=\"EN-IN\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW192914746\">l, serial number, and location</span></span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW192914746\" lang=\"EN-IN\" xml:lang=\"EN-IN\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW192914746\">.</span></span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW192914746\" lang=\"EN-IN\" xml:lang=\"EN-IN\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW192914746\"> </span></span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW192914746\" lang=\"EN-IN\" xml:lang=\"EN-IN\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW192914746\">These data are typically contained in work order records that provide documentation of every task performed on the device. As a result, the inventory database will con</span></span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW192914746\" lang=\"EN-IN\" xml:lang=\"EN-IN\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW192914746\">tain the entire technical </span></span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW192914746\" lang=\"EN-IN\" xml:lang=\"EN-IN\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW192914746\">history for each device in the inventory.</span></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The major objective of an inspection is to determine whether the equipment is operating in a state of control and in compliance with the regulations. The facility's commitment to quality is vital, regardless of the type of company or product that is being manufactured.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One important aspect of an inspection is to identify defective product, non-conforming product and system failures. The way in which companies investigate and correct objectionable conditions and deficient manufacturing and control systems is an important part of an inspection and typically illustrates the level of quality within a facility.</span>",

General safety auditing is popular where the objectives &amp; concepts are clear whereas ESA is a specialized area that is still in the process of being understood by many. In factories, around 8% of all fatalities are due to accidents caused by electricity. Data compiled by international organizations like National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), indicate that nearly one fourth of all fires are caused by electrical appliances or installations. Major fire incidents in various types of occupancies over a number of years show that nearly 40% of the fires are initiated by electrical causes such as short circuits, overloading, loose electrical connections.\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Although electrical hazards will be identified and assessed in general safety audits, comprehensive electrical safety audits can provide a thorough review of the electrical system. This could identify potential electrical hazards, flaws in design system, maintenance system, etc.</p>\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Electrical Safety Audit Service can be broadly classified into 3 major areas namely:</strong></h3>\n<ol style=\"text-align: left;\">\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pre-Audit</span></li>\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Audit</span></li>\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post-Audit</span></li>\n</ol>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Pre-Safety Electrical Audit</strong></h2>\nAn effective ESA programme should include elements such as competent audit team formation, pre_audit briefing, collection &amp; review of relevant information (preventive maintenance documentation, accident reports, electrical inspector’s reports, history cards), discussion with safety &amp; electrical officers, plant visit and then the consolidation to the top management.\n\nDefining scope of Electrical Safety audit based on the specific requirement is the first step in the process of Electrical Safety auditing. Typical ESA scope of work could include:\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Physical inspection of the area with reference to standards and other relevant codes of Practice &amp;identifying electrical hazards (shocks, fires, etc.).</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reviewing the role of electrical safety in the total safety system.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Review of protection devices / system of the electrical installation.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Review of adequacy of cables, motors, etc. based on actual load current measurements and cable current carrying capacities.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Review of electrical accidents to identify root cause of the accidents.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Review the EPM (Electrical Preventive Maintenance) programme in the plant and to examine the documentation, checklists, work permit, test records, etc. and to suggest recommendations as per applicable standards.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To identify training needs of the plant employees from the point of view of electrical safety.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To evaluate the earthling system (installation and maintenance) in the plant based on IS 3043 and to suggest recommendations.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Review of the following test records, evaluating the test results and to suggest recommendations as per applicable standards.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transformer oil test.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Insulation Resistance Tests.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earth Resistance tests.(The checking of test procedures and checking of test result interpretations are also part of this exercise).</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To evaluate the potential electrical fire hazards in the plant electrical installation and to suggest fire protection measures as per applicable standards and Indian Electricity Rules.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To identify the ESD (Electro-Static Hazards in the plant and to suggest recommendations as per applicable standards</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The pre-audit questionnaire for ESA could include the following aspects:</strong></p>\n\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Process details</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Electrical Single Line Diagram</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name plate details of major electrical equipment</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Details of classified zones in the plant</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Details of flammable chemicals handled in the plant</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Details of electrical accidents in the plant</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Details of addition / expansion of the plant including electrical installation</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overview of electrical maintenance system</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Audit  Preperation / Reference:</strong></h2>\nThe questionnaire is a vital tool for successful inspection and time spent onits preparation is as valuable as that taken by the audit itself. Auditing experience will reveal the need for supplementing or modifying it, provided that the auditors adopt a flexible approach to their task, and the danger of confining attention only to those matters listed in the original questionnaire must be avoided. Checklists can be made with reference to:\n<ul style=\"text-align: left;\">\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Statutory Regulations</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Non-Statutory Standards (national and international)</span></li>\n</ul>\nTo understand the efficiancy of the various electrical safety elements, the grouping as indicated below will be of use.

This involves visiting the plant to identify electrical hazards as per the scope of the audit. In electrical safety audits, the incoming electrical supply receiving section (outdoor substation and main transformer) is inspected first. Then the main sub-station housing the PCCs or MCCs and the cable gallery (if present) is inspected. Next are the electrical equipment installed in various process sections, the cabling and the distribution transformers located in the plant are visited.\n\nThe aspects such as earthing, lightning protection,maintenance condition,loose cabling, temporary wiring, electrical firehazards, shock potential, etc. are critically lookedinto. The checklist provided in the ‘Pre-audit Preparation’ section is rather a comprehensiveattempt, covering almost all-electrical safety aspect\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Review of Documentation / Records</b></h3>\nNormally, this part is taken up after the field visits. All the relevant maintenance documentation, test records, electrical records, electrical inspector reports, OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) service manuals, History cards are subjected to detailed examination. All the relevant drawings (electrical single line diagram, earthing layout, hazardous are a classification drawings, protection system schematic, equipment layout,lightning protection drawings) are also checked against actual installation and commended upon, with reference to applicable standards\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Post Electrical Safety Audit</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Management Abstract </strong></p>\nThe management abstract as the name implies contains the salient observations noted during the audit and the recommendations in a nutshell. Management needs  to understand those hazards that are harmful to their employees and to the property. Any prudent management will consider seriously potential hazards that can affect their business (directly as well as indirectly) and will take immediate action. Considering the importance of this section, every care has to be taken in choosing appropriate words and to effectively convey the message, depending upon the criticality of the hazard.\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\nThis section generally contains the ESA scope of work, exclusions in the audit scope, assistance provided during the audit, details of the audit team, client’s officials contacted during the audit, audit methodology, audit duration. and summary of the client’s safety system, safety auditing policy, training strategy, Accident Prevention Program, and the management commitment towards safety.\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Overview of Electrical System</strong></p>\nThe overview section contains the details of the electrical power supply and the power distribution. This section can also discuss the details of critical electrical installations, name plate details of critical electrical equipment, recent alterations/additions carried in the electrical installation, captive generation details, etc. This section can also discuss about the future expansion plans with respect to electrical capacity.\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Specific Observations and Recommendations</strong></p>\nThis is the most important section containing the specific observations and recommendations in the plant observed during the audit. Normally, the observations are noted area/plant wise. Checklist method is found effective and various standards (both statutes and non-statutes) are available for reference. The format for this section is given in this paper.\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Lightning Protection System Evaluation</strong></p>\nThe review of the existing lightning protection system of the plant as per the applicable national (IS: 2309) and international standards (NFPA 780) is carried out in this section on a sample basis. The various maintenance aspects are also evaluated in this section. If required, the fundamental step of ascertaining the need for protecting buildings /structures by calculating the risk factor is also carried out.\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Electro-Static Hazards- Control Measures</strong></p>\nESD (Electro-Static Discharges) is a critical area where the potential ESD hazards are to be identified and necessary solutions are to be provided. Making the client aware of the potential accidents that can occur due to Electro-static discharges, minimum ignition energy required for fire/explosion, concept of equi-potential bonding and earthing, etc. are also crucial to make them understand the ESD hazards in the right light.\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Hazardous Areas – Observations and Recommendations</strong></p>\nThis is another crucial area that needs to be evaluated critically. Although hazardous areas are critical, they are mostly neglected in most of the hazardous plants. The design principle of flameproof equipment makes it a special equipment that needs ‘special care’. Area classification into zones and installing various types of electrical equipment are the critical factors in controlling accidents in hazardous areas.\n\nSafety audits are an important part of a company’s control system. The auditing schemes does not remove from the management and supervisors the necessity for regular checking and rechecking to ensure that people under their control are working in a safe manner. Their application and use do not remove the need for proper care and responsibility at all levels in day-to-day operations.",

        "content": "<em><strong>Carelabs is authorized provider of Electrical Installation's Study, Analysis, Inspection, and Certification services in UAE, and offer GFCI Standard Inspection Service.</strong></em>\n\nOne of the most important aspects of being a home inspector is detecting safety hazards. Unsafe electrical practices are common safety hazards home inspectors will come across.\nOne area of the electrical inspection in particular is Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCI). OSHA 1910.399 defines a ground fault circuit interrupter, or GFCI, as \"a device whose function is to interrupt the electric circuit to load when a fault current to ground exceeds some predetermined value, that is less than that required to operate the over-current protective device of the supply circuit.\nCharles Dalziel first developed a transistorized version of the ground-fault circuit interrupter in 1961. Through the 1970s, most GFCIs were of the circuit-breaker type. This version of the GFCI was prone to frequent false trips due to poor alternating-current characteristics of 120-volt insulations. Especially in circuits with long cable runs, current leaking along the conductors’ insulation could be high enough that breakers tended to trip at the slightest imbalance. Since the early 1980s, ground-fault circuit interrupters have been built into outlet receptacles, and advances in design in both receptacle and breaker types have improved reliability while reducing instances of false trips.\nA Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter, commonly called a GFI or GFCI, is most commonly installed on exterior outlets, or in areas where there is a water source (bathroom or kitchen sink) near the outlet. They are easily identified by two buttons in the middle of the receptacle, sometimes the buttons are coloured.\n\nA GFCI is typically a receptacle with small buttons on it that usually say “Test” and “Reset”. It can also be built into a circuit breaker that is installed in an electric panel.\nGFCI units are designed to guard the users of electrical appliances from electrocution because of dangerous ground faults or short circuits, by mechanically turning off electricity when a fault is detected. Home inspectors test the operation of GFCI’s as part of their evaluation. They may also recommend the installation of GFCI receptacles near plumbing fixtures. But they weren’t always required. GFCI wiring regulations only apply to recent wiring installations and constructions. Older homes are not obliged to install GFI’s unless they are been rewired or a new outlet is being added in a location that would require a GFCI in a new house.\nAs per the 2011 NEC, GFCIs are required in the following areas of the home, excluding pools, spas &amp; boathouses.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Required to be in readily accessible locations</li>\n \t<li>All bathroom receptacles</li>\n \t<li>All garage receptacles and accessory building receptacles</li>\n \t<li>All indoor receptacles in unfinished basements, excluding permanently installed fire alarm or burglar alarm systems</li>\n \t<li>All outdoor receptacles, excluding GFPE circuits dedicated to non-readily accessible receptacles for snow-melting or deicing equipment</li>\n \t<li>All receptacles in crawl spaces or below grade level</li>\n \t<li>All kitchen receptacles serving kitchen counters</li>\n \t<li>Receptacles within 6 ft. of all non-kitchen sinks</li>\n \t<li>Whirlpool tubs receptacles</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>How does a GFCI Work?</strong></h2>\nThe GFCI has a sensor inside that detects variations in current that flow through the appliance that is connected to it, by comparing the current flow to the appliance and the current flow from the appliance. If there is a potentially dangerous drop off in the current, then the GFCI turns off all power by tripping a relay within it in less than one second. If a GFCI turns off your appliance, then you will have to press the reset button. A GFCI has two buttons: a test button and a reset button. If a GFCI turns off your appliance, then you will have to press the reset button. On a home inspection you should be testing each GFCI for proper operation with a GFCI 3 –prong tester.\nInspectors need to remember that they are not there to detect cite code violations, but rather, are there to make recommendations to the client if additional safety can be added or upgraded. For example if inspecting a bathroom in a house that was built in 1987, or for that fact 2007, and the receptacle is checked and is properly grounded but does not have GFCI protection, it should not be written up as a safety hazard, even though the code for GFCI protection in a bathroom went into effect in 1975. Instead, this should be expressed verbally and should be written in the report as, “for additional safety, recommend GFCI protected receptacles in the bathroom.” It is okay to recommend GFCI protected receptacles in locations that typically require them but do not currently have them.\n<h3>There are three types of GFCIs</h3>\n<strong>Receptacle Type</strong>\nThe Receptacle Type incorporates a GFCI device within one or more receptacle outlets. Such devices are becoming popular because of their low cost.\n\n<strong>Portable Type</strong>\nPortable Type GFCIs come in several styles, all designed for easy transport. Some are designed to plug into existing non-GFCI outlets, or connect with a cord and plug arrangement.\n\n<strong>Cord-Connected Type</strong>\nThe Cord-Connected Type of GFCI is an attachment plug incorporating the GFCI module. It protects the cord and any equipment attached to the cord. The attachment plug has a non-standard appearance with test and reset buttons.\n<h3>Ground Fault Circuit Inspection Requirements</h3>\n<strong>Employers provide:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Written description of program</li>\n \t<li>Competent person to implement the program</li>\n \t<li>Inspection and testing</li>\n \t<li>Records of test results</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Inspections/Tests:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Visual inspection of the following equipment is required:</li>\n \t<li>Cord sets</li>\n \t<li>Cap, plug and receptacle of cord sets</li>\n \t<li>Equipment connected by cord and plug</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Exceptions:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Receptacles and cord sets that are fixed and not exposed to damage</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Conduct tests for:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Continuity of equipment of grounding conductor</li>\n \t<li>Proper terminal connection of equipment grounding conductor</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Frequency of tests:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Before first use</li>\n \t<li>After repair and before placing back in service</li>\n \t<li>Before use after suspected damage</li>\n \t<li>Every three months—however, cord sets and receptacles exposed to damage must be tested at regular intervals not to exceed six months</li>\n</ul>\nAll GFCIs shall be tested once every three months using the following procedures to make sure they are working properly and protecting the employees from electric shock.\n<ul>\n \t<li>To test a GFCI, first plug a test-light or shop-light into the outlet, the light should be ON. Then press the TEST button on the GFCI , the GFCIs RESET button should pop-out and light should go out.</li>\n \t<li>If the RESET button pops out and the light doesn’t go out the GFCI has been improperly wired.</li>\n \t<li>If the RESET button doesn’t pop out the GFCI is defective and should be replaced.</li>\n \t<li>If the GFCI is functioning properly, and the lamp goes out. Press the RESET button to restore power to the outlet.</li>\n</ul>\nThe GFCI will not protect you from line contact hazards (i.e. a person holding two \"hot\" wires, a hot and a neutral wire in each hand, or contacting an overhead power line). However, it protects against the most common form of electrical shock hazard, the ground-fault. It also protects against fires, overheating, and destruction of wire insulation.",

Switchgears are used both to de-energize equipment to allow work to be done safely, and to clear faults downstream.\n<h2>Electrical Switchgear is Composed of Passive and Active Components</h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Passive components include the horizontal and vertical bus structures.</li>\n \t<li>Active components are the power circuit breakers and fusible switching devices. Their role is to protect the electrical assets downstream, disconnect the circuit, and protect personnel in case of an arc flash event.</li>\n</ul>\nPassive and active components require regular maintenance to ensure equipment integrity and proper mechanical and electrical functionality, as well as to optimize the equipment’s useful life. A regularly scheduled electrical system preventive maintenance program is intended to detect, repair, or replace affected electrical components, parts, or equipment before they lead to catastrophic damages, significant power interruptions, and loss of business functions. Current Injection Tests for Switchgear and Switchboards Current-injection tests will prove current wiring is in accordance with design specifications.\n<h2><strong>Ten Tips to Optimize the Life of Electrical Switchgear</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Perform Infrared Inspections</li>\n \t<li>Exercise Circuit Breakers Annually</li>\n \t<li>Don’t Neglect Recommended Maintenance</li>\n \t<li>Recondition the Equipment</li>\n \t<li>Keep Good Records and Trend Performance</li>\n \t<li>Upgrade the Equipment</li>\n \t<li>Outsource Preventive Maintenance Via a Long-Term Maintenance Contract</li>\n \t<li>Comply with NFPA 70E</li>\n \t<li>Utilize Predictive Maintenance Tools and perform a Short Circuit Analysis and a Time Current Coordination Study</li>\n</ul>\nYou should regularly inspect, maintain and test all switchgear and its environment, for example the switchroom. In all cases you should do this in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.\n<h2><strong>Switchgear Inspection</strong></h2>\n<strong>You should inspect substations regularly. During the inspection work you should prioritise any remedial actions as follows: </strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Immediately (this should always be the case when security of the substation enclosure has been interfered with).</li>\n \t<li>Earliest possible opportunity.</li>\n \t<li>Next scheduled maintenance.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>You should include the following items in the inspection schedule:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Switchgear environment (switchroom access and surrounds, including fence and external walls if outdoors), signs of water getting in/dampness, signs of unauthorized access and/or interference, condition of fire fighting equipment and warning notices, and general housekeeping.</li>\n \t<li>Signs of abnormal conditions such as high temperature, smell of hot substances or ozone, presence of smoke, signs of fresh leakage of oil or compound, distortion and evidence of deformation on enclosures.</li>\n \t<li>General condition of switchgear, such as corrosion, evidence of leaks, fluid levels, presence/condition of labels, padlocks and key exchange interlocks, condition of instruments and protection equipment.</li>\n \t<li>Condition of ancillary equipment such as batteries and chargers, control panels etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>General Visual and Mechanical Inspection of Switchgear</b></h2>\n<strong>Switchgear should be inspected for proper anchorage, alignment, grounding and required clearances.</strong>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">1.) Inspect the physical, electrical, and mechanical condition of switchgear or switchboard, including its anchorage, alignment, grounding and required clearances. When performing acceptance testing, verify that the equipment nameplate data matches project drawings and specifications. This is important because switchboards are designed and rated for specific applications and should not be used otherwise, unless explicitly approved by the manufacturer.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">2.) The unit should be clean and all shipping braces, loose parts, and documentation shipped inside the cubicles removed. Keep all documentation in a safe location for maintenance personnel in the future while loose parts and switchgear tools should be safely stored outside of the enclosure for easy access. When performing maintenance programs, clean the assembly using industry accepted methods of cleaning.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">3.) For initial acceptance, verify that fuse and/or circuit breaker sizes, types, and protective settings match the project drawings and coordination study. Circuit breakers equipped with microprocessor-communication packages should be programmed with the proper digital address. All instrument transformer current and voltage ratios should also correspond to project drawings.</p>\n\n<h2>Moisture and Corona Inspections for Switchgear and Switchboards</h2>\nIf corona occurs in switchgear assemblies, it is usually localized in thin air gaps that exist between a high-voltage bus bar and its adjacent insulation or between two adjacent insulating members. Corona might also form around bolt heads or other sharp projections that are not properly insulated or shielded. Corona in low-voltage switchgear is practically nonexistent.\n<ol>\n \t<li>Inspect for evidence of moisture or corona when performing maintenance inspections. On outdoor assemblies, roof or wall seams should be checked for evidence of leakage, and any leaking seams should be sealed with weatherproof caulk. Prolonged leakage can be identified by rust or water marks on surfaces adjacent to and below leaky seams. The assembly base should be checked for openings that could permit water to drain into the interior, and any such openings should be caulked or grouted. Larger openings should be sealed to prevent rodent intrusion. Many electric inspection protocols call for using ultrasound to test enclosed electric gear before opening to prevent arc flash incidents.</li>\n \t<li>All interior and exterior lighting should be checked for proper operation. It is essential for personnel safety that the area be well lit at all times in case of emergency response and other security reasons.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Wiring and Bolted Connection Checks for Switchgear and Switchboards</h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bolted electrical connections should be inspected for high resistance, either by use of a low-resistance ohmmeter, calibrated torque-wrench, or infrared scan. Loose bolted electrical connections can lead to higher energy consumption and eventual equipment failure if not properly addressed.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When using a low-resistance ohmmeter, investigate values which deviate from those of similar bolted connections by more than 50 percent of the lowest value.</span></li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bolt-torque levels should be in accordance with manufacturer's published data.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>General Wiring Checks for Switchgear and Switchboards</h2>\nLoose control wires can lead to catastrophic failure if they are part of a critical protective circuit, such as a protective relay for a circuit breaker. Other critical functions like electrical charging and re-closing of circuit breakers can be inhibited if poor connections overheat and lose integrity.\n\nCheck that all wiring connections are tight and that wiring is secure to prevent damage during routine operation of moving parts, especially when removing draw-out circuit breakers or opening and closing cubicle doors. Gently tug on control wires to ensure a tight connection or use a screwdriver to gently verify torque on the connection. Infrared scans are also very effective for finding loose wires in control circuits.\n<h2>Moving Parts and Interlock Checks for Switchgear and Switchboards</h2>\n<ol>\n \t<li>Confirm the correct operation and sequencing of electrical and mechanical interlock systems. Attempt closure on locked-open devices and attempt to open locked-closed devices.</li>\n \t<li>Test key interlock systems by making key exchanges with all devices included in the interlock scheme as applicable. All of these systems are essential for safety of both the operator and the equipment.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Lubrication of Switchgear and Switchboards</h2>\nCheck for appropriate lubrication on moving current-carrying parts and moving/sliding surfaces to keep everything operating smoothly. This includes hinges, locks, and latches when performing maintenance tests. Lubricate as necessary using industry accepted lubrications and techniques.\n<h2>Insulators and Barrier Checks for Switchgear and Switchboards</h2>\nTracking is an electrical discharge phenomenon caused by electrical stress on insulation. This stress can occur phase-to-phase or phase-to-ground. Although tracking can occur internally in certain insulating materials, these materials as a rule are not used in medium- or high-voltage switchgear insulation. Tracking, when it occurs in switchgear assemblies, normally is found on insulation surfaces.\n\n<strong>Accumulated dirt, oil or grease might require liquid solvents or other alternative methods to be removed. </strong>\n<ol>\n \t<li>Electrical insulators should be inspected for evidence of physical damage or contaminated surfaces. Damage caused by electrical distress is normally evident on the surface of insulating members in the form of corona erosion or markings or tracking paths.</li>\n \t<li>Inspect barrier and shutter assemblies for proper installation and operation. All active components should be exercised; mechanical indicating devices should be inspected for correct operation.</li>\n \t<li>Ensure that vents are clear and filters are in place. Screens covering ventilation openings should be in place to prevent entry of rodents or small animals.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Bolted Connection Electrical Tests for Switchgear and Switchboards</h2>\n<ol>\n \t<li>Perform resistance measurements through bolted electrical connections with a low-resistance ohmmeter. Measure line/load bus resistance end-to-end and to each distribution section.</li>\n \t<li>Verify dual-source switchgear bussing is correct at the tie breaker. Compare resistance values to values of similar connections and investigate values that deviate by more than 50 percent of the lowest value.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Insulation Electrical Tests for Switchgear and Switchboards</h2>\n<ol>\n \t<li>Insulation–resistance tests should be performed with a megohmmeter for one minute on each bus section, phase-to-phase and phase-to-ground. The used is dependent on the rating of the equipment and should be applied in accordance with manufacturer's published data. can be used as a guideline if manufacturer's data cannot be found.</li>\n \t<li>Insulation-resistance values of bus insulation depends on voltage class and should be in accordance with manufacturer's published data. Values of insulation resistance less than manufacturer's recommendations should be investigated.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Dielectric Withstand Test for Switchgear and Switchboards</h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AC Hipots are recommended for dielectric withstands testing circuit breakers.</span>\n<ol>\n \t<li>Perform a dielectric withstand voltage test on each bus section, each phase-to-ground with phases not under test grounded, using a test voltage in accordance with manufacturer's published data.</li>\n \t<li>Apply test voltage for one minute. If no evidence of distress or insulation failure is observed by the end of the total time of voltage application, the test specimen is considered to have passed the test. Dielectric Withstand is an optional test when performing routine maintenance per NETA.</li>\n</ol>\nImportant: Dielectric withstand voltage tests should not proceed until insulation-resistance levels are raised above the recommended minimum values.\n<h2>Control Wiring Electrical Tests for Switchgear and Switchboards</h2>\nPerform insulation-resistance tests on control wiring with respect to ground. Apply 500 volts dc for 300-volt rated cable and 1000 volts dc for 600-volt rated cable for one minute each.\n\nImportant: For units with solid-state components or control devices that cannot tolerate the applied test voltage, follow manufacturer's recommendation. Isolate these components and use a ohmmeter to check the circuit before applying test voltage.\nMinimum insulation-resistance values of control wiring should be comparable to previously obtained results but not less than two megaohms. This test is optional for both maintenance and initial acceptance.\n<h2>Instrument Transformer Tests for Switchgear and Switchboards</h2>\nCurrent transformers are just some of the many instrument transformers found in switchgear and switchboards.\nThe procedure for inspecting and testing instrument transformers is beyond the scope of this guide as each type has its own procedure. Instrument transformers generally include current transformers, voltage transformers, and control power transformers. Conduct electrical tests on instrument transformers in accordance with NETA. Where applicable, testing of instrument transformers generally include:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Visual/Mechanical Inspection</li>\n \t<li>Insulation Resistance Test</li>\n \t<li>Dielectric Withstand</li>\n \t<li>Turns Ratio Tests</li>\n \t<li>Excitation Tests</li>\n \t<li>Burden Test</li>\n \t<li>Power/Dissipation Factor</li>\n \t<li>Secondary Wiring Integrity</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Circuit Breaker and Switch Tests for Switchgear and Switchboards</h2>\nIt's essential that circuit breakers be tested and maintained to ensure proper operation during electrical faults. Photo: Vacuum Interrupter Testing\nThe procedure for the inspection/testing of circuit breakers and switches is beyond the scope of this guide as each type and voltage class has its own procedure. Conduct electrical tests on circuit breakers in accordance with NETA. Where applicable, testing of circuit breakers generally include:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Visual/Mechanical Inspection</li>\n \t<li>Insulation Resistance</li>\n \t<li>Dielectric Withstand</li>\n \t<li>Contact/Pole Resistance</li>\n \t<li>Electrical Operations</li>\n \t<li>Vacuum Integrity</li>\n \t<li>Power/Dissipation Factor</li>\n \t<li>Protective Devices and Instrument Transformers</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Control Power Transfer Scheme Test for Switchgear and Switchboards</h2>\nSwitchgear and switchboard assemblies equipped with multiple control power sources should be checked for proper function of the control transfer scheme by connecting a rated secondary voltage to each source. Transfer relays should perform as designed when the primary source is lost.\n<h2>Ground Resistance Electrical Tests for Switchgear and Switchboards</h2>\n<ol>\n \t<li>Perform resistance measurements through bolted ground connections with a low-resistance ohmmeter, if applicable. Compare bolted connection resistance values to values of similar connections and investigate values which deviate from those of similar bolted connections by more than 50 percent of the lowest value.</li>\n \t<li>Determine the resistance between the main grounding system and all major electrical equipment frames, system neutral, and derived neutral points by means of point-to-point testing using a low-resistance ohmmeter. Values which exceed 0.5 ohm should be investigated.</li>\n \t<li>Perform fall-of-potential or alternative ground resistance test in accordance with IEEE on the main grounding electrode or system. The resistance between the main grounding electrode and ground should be no greater than 5 ohms for large commercial or industrial systems and 1 ohm or less for generating or transmission station grounds, unless otherwise specified by the owner</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Metering Electrical Tests for Switchgear and Switchboards</h2>\nMetering devices are verified using secondary voltage and current levels.\nGenerally, metering devices are verified using secondary voltage and current levels supplied by a relay test set or other secondary source.\n\nDetermine accuracy of all meters and calibrate watt-hour meters in accordance with NETA.\n<h2>Current Injection Tests for Switchgear and Switchboards</h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Current-injection tests will prove current wiring is in accordance with design specifications. This is an optional test according to NETA.</li>\n \t<li>Perform current-injection tests on the entire current circuit in each section of switchgear by secondary injection with magnitudes that produce a minimum current of 1.0 ampere flows in the secondary circuit. Verify correct magnitude of current at each device in the circuit.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Cubicle Heater Tests for Switchgear and Switchboards</h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Moisture accumulation is prevented by heat and air circulation. It's important, therefore, to make sure the heating and ventilating systems are functioning properly to reduce internal condensation.</li>\n \t<li>The operation of switchgear/switchboard heaters should be verified along with their controller. Heaters should be operational.</li>\n</ul>\nTip: Infrared cameras are the easiest way to verify heater functionality without making contact with the equipment.\n<h2>Surge Arrester Tests for Switchgear and Switchboards</h2>\nInspection and testing procedures for surge arresters exceeds the scope of this document. Surge Arresters should be performed in accordance with NETA. Testing these devices typically consist of applying a high voltage across the arrester to ground and observing the leakage current.\n<h2>Dual-Source Phasing Check for Switchgear and Switchboards</h2>\nDuring initial acceptance, perform phasing checks on double-ended or dual-source switchgear to insure correct bus phasing from each source. Phasing checks should prove the switchgear or switchboard phasing is correct and in accordance with the system design.",

        "content": "<em><strong>Carelabs is authorized provider of Electrical Installation's Study, Analysis, Inspection, and Certification services in UAE, and offer electrical installations certification services.</strong></em>\n\nElectrical installation certificate is something you should have every time some work done which includes extending a circuit or new surface or even a few orders. What is the benefit of getting an installation certificate? It ensures that the work just completed is compliant and secure and assures that it is safe to use.\nWhether you are a manufacturer or operator, you need to ensure cost-effective and safe use of your electrical installations and power plants.\nElectrical Installation Certificates (EICs) and Minor Electrical Installation Works Certificates (MEIWCs) provide you, as the person responsible for the safety of an electrical installation, with a declaration that the new installation, or alteration or addition, is safe to use at the time it was put into service.\nKeeping hold of these certificates also provides a basis for any further inspection and testing, as they can help save on costly exploratory work which might otherwise be needed in future. Additionally, in the event of a claim that injury or fire was caused by an electrical installation, certificates are documentary evidence which help show that the installation had been installed to a satisfactory standard of safety.\n<h2>The Electrical Installations Certificate will indicate whether the electrical work that has been carried out is:</h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>New - where the whole installation has been installed as new, if a complete rewire has been carried out.</li>\n \t<li>Addition - applies if an existing installation has been modified by adding one or more new circuits.</li>\n \t<li>Alteration - applies where one or more existing circuits have been modified or extended (for example to add a socket), or items such as a consumer unit (fuse box) and switching equipment have been replaced.</li>\n</ul>\nAn Electrical Installation Certificate must be issued for all new electrical installations. It may also be required for an alteration or addition to the installation – depending upon whether or not a new circuit has been installed. Where an alteration or addition is carried out but does not include a new circuit, a MEIWC or an EIC may be used.\n<h2>The Electrical Installation Certificate will need to be issued any time that there is:</h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>A newly installed installation</li>\n \t<li>When any new single circuit or multiple circuits are being added to any installation that already exists.</li>\n \t<li>When there is any change of distribution board (consumer unit)</li>\n \t<li>When there has been any alteration to a circuit and that alteration has required a change to the protective device.</li>\n \t<li>Following initial verification, and after a full inspection and testing procedures have been undertaken, the Electrical Installation Certificate has to be completed. This is something that is required by law.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Carelabs Electrical Installation Certification Process</h2>\nEvery time an Electrical Contractor completes a new electrical installation, extension, or modification to an existing installation he/she is obliged to test and certify that the installation complies with current standards. These standards are set by the Electro Technical Council of Ireland (ETCI). A validated Electrical Completion Certificate, where applicable, must be sent to ESB Networks by the electrical contractor's regulatory body before any connection work can commence. Every customer should receive a copy of an Electrical Completion Certificate whenever electrical work is completed. Make sure you keep your copy of the certificate. This requirement helps to ensure your safety.\nIn order to verify that it complies with the relevant requirements of the standard. With self-certification, there is an absolute requirement for full inspection and testing procedures. This chapter explains the minimum verification procedures that are required by Health and Safety legislation and BS 7671. The Wiring Regulations require that every installation must be inspected and tested, both during erection and before being put into service. The persons signing certification take responsibility for all work, hidden and obvious. A signatory on an Electrical installation certificate (EIC) can only be responsible for work for which there is a contractual arrangement. Inspection and testing may be carried out by a specialized operator, or the installer, or perhaps the design consultant.\n<h2>Who can apply for Electrical Installation Certification?</h2>\nProperty owners, electrical contractors and licensed wiremen can apply to have their electrical work inspected and certified.\n<h3>Carelabs Provide Certificates after testing for faults like:</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>If any of your electrical circuits or equipment are overloaded.</li>\n \t<li>If any potential electric shock risks and fire hazards are present\nIf any defective electrical work is present</li>\n \t<li>If any lack of earthing or bonding is present</li>\n \t<li>Tests are also carried out on wiring and fixed electrical equipment to check that they are safe. A schedule of circuits is also provided, which is invaluable for a property</li>\n \t<li>The suitability of the switchgear and controlgear. For example, an old fusebox with a wooden back, cast-iron switches, or a mixture of both will need replacing</li>\n \t<li>The serviceability of switches, sockets and lighting fittings. Items that may need replacing include: older round-pin sockets, round light switches, cables with fabric coating hanging from ceiling roses to light fittings, black switches and sockets mounted in skirting boards</li>\n \t<li>The type of wiring system and its condition. For example, cables coated in black rubber were phased out in the 1960s. Likewise cables coated in lead or fabric is even older and may well need replacing (modern cables use longer-lasting pvc insulation)</li>\n \t<li>Making sure you have a fusebox with a suitable residual current device (RCD)</li>\n \t<li>The presence of adequate identification and notices</li>\n \t<li>The extent of any wear and tear, damage or other deterioration</li>\n \t<li>Any changes in the use of the premises that have led to, or may lead to, unsafe conditions</li>\n</ul>\nIf any dangerous or potentially dangerous condition or conditions are found, the overall condition of the electrical installation will be declared to be ‘unsatisfactory’, meaning that remedial action is required without delay to remove the risks to people, and damage to equipment in the premises.\n<h2>Minor Electrical Installation Work Certificate</h2>\nThe Minor Works Certificate is intended to be used for additions and alterations to an installation that do not extend to the provision of a new circuit. Examples include the addition of a socket-outlet or lighting point to an existing circuit, the relocation/replacement of a light switch etc. This Certificate may also be used for the replacement of equipment such as accessories or luminaries, but not for the replacement of distribution boards or similar items. Appropriate inspection and testing, however, should always be carried out irrespective of the extent of the work undertaken.\n<h2>Carelabs Electrical installations certificate will have the following list of regulations printed:</h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>The Electrical Installation Certificate will be used only for the initial certification of a new installation or for an alteration or addition to an existing installation where new circuits have been introduced. It is not to be used for a Periodic Inspection for which a Periodic Inspection Report form should be used. For an alteration or addition which does not extend to the introduction of new circuits, a Minor Electrical Installation Works Certificate may be used. The original Certificate is to be given to the person ordering the work (Regulation 742-01-03). A duplicate should be retained by the contractor.</li>\n \t<li>This certificate is only valid if accompanied by the Schedule of Inspections and the Schedule(s) of Test Results.</li>\n \t<li>The signatures appended are those of the persons authorized byx the companies executing the work of design, construction and inspection and testing respectively. A signatory authorized to certify more than one category of work should sign in each of the appropriate places.</li>\n \t<li>The time interval recommended before the first periodic inspection must be inserted.</li>\n \t<li>The page numbers for each of the Schedules of Test Results will be indicated, together with the total number of sheets involved.</li>\n \t<li>For the proposed date for the next inspection, it should be taken into consideration the frequency and quality of maintenance that the installation can reasonably be expected to receive during its intended life, and the period should be agreed between the designer, installer and other relevant parties.</li>\n</ul>",

An electrical inspector is an authorized person from the government and municipality who is responsible for checking the electrical connections to ensure they comply with the law codes and requirements in the area. Commercial electrical inspectors conduct inspections of all wiring, electrical equipment/fixtures, alarm systems and all associated systems regarding electrical power sources.\n<h2><strong>Carelabs Inspectors Review the Following Type of Installations</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>New installations/additions of electrical services</li>\n \t<li>New installations/additions of electrical wiring, fixtures, equipment</li>\n \t<li>Alterations of existing electrical services, wiring, equipment</li>\n \t<li>Fire alarm/annunciations system installations</li>\n \t<li>Transformers, communication towers, hydro vaults</li>\n \t<li>Outdoor lighting</li>\n \t<li>Temporary and special events services</li>\n \t<li>Emergency turn-on and disconnect of services</li>\n \t<li>New, additions/alterations to electrical components of mechanical systems:</li>\n \t<li>Heating systems</li>\n \t<li>Cooling systems</li>\n \t<li>Venting systems</li>\n \t<li>Cooking exhaust systems</li>\n \t<li>Dust Collection systems</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Why is Electrical Inspection Important?</strong></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many reasons behind the necessity of getting an electrical inspection done. Some of the most common ones are:</span>\n<h3>Protection Against Possible Surges</h3>\nThis is a common phenomenon in different regions, especially when there is a storm. Electrical surges can not only ruin your appliances, but can also create short circuits in your house. When the inspection is being done, the inspector will check for different points in the wiring that can cause this type of mishap.\n<h3>Fire</h3>\nMany a times it has been seen that an electrical short circuit has been the reason behind a fire breakout in a house. These short circuits are caused by different loose wires in the meter or in the cabling itself. During the inspection, the inspector can easily recognize these faults and ask you to rectify them.\n<h3>Shocks</h3>\nImagine touching an electronic appliance and immediately experiencing a surging electric current in your body. Although the impact may not be that disastrous; however, this could lead to other mishaps easily. Apart from this, the body current in an electronic appliance can easily hamper its performance or can render it completely non-workable. An electrical inspector can catch these faults in the wiring in time to rectify them.\n<h2>Steps for Commercial Electrical Inspection Process</h2>\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-4419 alignleft\" src=\"http://carelabz.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Electrical-Inspection.jpg\" alt=\"Electrical Inspection Process\" width=\"750\" height=\"100\" />\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIEC 60335 is the most widely applied standard for electrical safety testing, especially for domestic appliances. Many safety testing standards in the world have been based on it. To safeguard workplace health and safety, many sections of the Occupational Health and Safety Regulation provide guidelines on electrical safety and the appropriate equipment required to work on low and high voltage electrical appliances.",

Coordinated provisions result in a protective measure. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:120,&quot;335559739&quot;:120}\"> </span>\n\nOne of the most common protective measures consists in “automatic disconnection of supply” where the provision for fault protection consists in the implementation of a system earthing. Deep understanding of each standardized system (TT, TN and IT system) is necessary for a correct implementation. Electrical fires are caused by overloads, short circuits and earth leakage currents, but also by electric arcs in cables and connections. These dangerous electric arcs are not detected by residual current devices nor by circuit breakers or fuses. The arc fault detector technology makes it possible to detect dangerous arcs and thus provide additional protection of installations. See Arc Fault Detection Devices (AFDD) for more information.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:120,&quot;335559739&quot;:120}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>LV Distribution</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:120,&quot;335559739&quot;:120}\"> </span></h2>\nThe system earthing is one protective measure commonly used for the protection against electric shocks. These systems earthings have a major impact on the LV electrical installation architecture and they need to be analysed as early as possible. Advantages and drawbacks are to be analysed for a correct selection.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:120,&quot;335559739&quot;:120}\"> </span>\n\nAnother aspect needing to be considered at the earlier stage is the external influences. In large electrical installation, different external influences may be encountered and need to be considered independently. As a result of these external influences proper selection of equipment according to their IP or IK codes has to be made.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:120,&quot;335559739&quot;:120}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>Sizing and Protection of Conductors</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:120,&quot;335559739&quot;:120}\"> </span></h2>\nSelection of cross-sectional-areas of cables or isolated conductors for line conductors is certainly one of the most important tasks of the design process of an electrical installation as this greatly influences the selection of over current protective devices, the voltage drop along these conductors and the estimation of the prospective short-circuit currents: the maximum value relates to the over current protection and the minimum value relates to the fault protection by automatic disconnection of supply. This has to be done for each circuit of the installation. Similar task is to be done for the neutral conductor and for the Protective Earth (PE) conductor. During an inspection, inspector have to check whether the dimension for this are precise or not.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:120,&quot;335559739&quot;:120}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>Overvoltage Protection</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:120,&quot;335559739&quot;:120}\"> </span></h2>\nDirect or indirect lightning strokes can damage electrical equipment at a distance of several kilometres. Operating voltage surges, transient and industrial frequency overvoltage can also produce the same consequences. All protective measures against overvoltage need to be installed. One of the most used corresponds to the use of Surge Protective Devices (SPD). Their selection; installation and protection within the electrical installation request some particular attention and need to be inspected.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:120,&quot;335559739&quot;:120}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>Harmonics</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:120,&quot;335559739&quot;:120}\"> </span></h2>\nHarmonic currents in the network affect the quality of energy and are at the origin of many disturbances as overloads, vibrations, ageing of equipment, trouble of sensitive equipment, of local area networks.

Hiring certified third-party testing organizations assures the owner that:<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:120,&quot;335559739&quot;:120,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span>\n\nThe certified technician has broad-based knowledge — this person is trained to inspect, test, maintain, and calibrate all types of electrical equipment in all types of industries.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:120,&quot;335559739&quot;:120,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span>\n\nNETA (International Electrical Testing Association) is the leading source of specifications, procedures, testing, and equipment performance requirements, not only for commissioning of new equipment, but also for testing the reliability, performance, and continued serviceability of existing equipment. A registered professional engineer will review all engineering reports. All tests will be performed objectively, independent of the manufacturer of the equipment, according to NETA specifications and using calibrated instruments traceable to the National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST).<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559738&quot;:120,&quot;335559739&quot;:120,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span>\n\nThe testing organization is a well-established, full-service electrical testing and maintenance business. The introduction of Third Party Certification effectively recognises that electricians can do the work of Building Control. As such it is important that it doesn’t weaken the approach that would be taken by a local authority and as such the Certifier must be notified by the installer before the work begins, and must be involved in inspecting the project throughout the installation – this scheme does not allow certification of finished work which can only be regularised by a local authority. Having a testing organization that meets these basic requirements is paramount if objectivity and quality are to be assured.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:120,&quot;335559739&quot;:120,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span>\n\n<em><strong>Carelabs is authorized provider of Electrical Installation’s Study, Analysis, Inspection, and Certification services in UAE, and provide Third Party Inspection of Electrical Installation and Certification.</strong></em>",
