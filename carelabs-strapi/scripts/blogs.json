        "content": "Harmonics are produced by non-linear loads that absorb non-sinusoidal current. These non-sinusoidal currents contain harmonic currents that interact with the impedance of the power distribution system to create voltage distortion that can affect both the distribution system equipment and the loads connected to it.\n\nIf the impedance changes with the applied voltage, then the load is considered non-linear. Due to this changing impedance, the current drawn by the non-linear load is also non-linear i.e. non-sinusoidal in nature, even when it is connected to a sinusoidal voltage source.\n\nThe most common loads, both in industrial surroundings and domestic ones, that can cause harmonics are:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Frequency / Variable speed drives</li>\n \t<li>Discharge lamps (high pressure sodium vapour lamp, mercury vapour lamp, low consumption, fluorescent, etc.)</li>\n \t<li>Rectifiers</li>\n \t<li>AC/DC Converters</li>\n \t<li>Arc welding</li>\n \t<li>Induction ovens</li>\n \t<li>UPS</li>\n \t<li>Computers and laptops</li>\n</ul>\nIn order to avoid or right harmonic problems that could happen within an industrial facility, an assessment of system harmonics must be done if:\n<ul>\n \t<li>A plant is enlarged and considerable non-linear loads are put in.</li>\n \t<li>A power factor rectification capacitor banks or line harmonic filters are inserted at the service entrance or in the neighborhood.</li>\n \t<li>A generator is inserted in the plant as a substitute stand-by power source.</li>\n \t<li>The utility company imposes more restrictive harmonic injection limits to the plant.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Why Voltage Harmonic Study and Analysis Important?</strong></h2>\nThe existence of harmonics doesn’t mean that the factory cannot run appropriately. Like other power quality phenomena, it depends on the stiffness of the power distribution system and the susceptibility of the equipment. There are numerous types of equipment that can have failures or mis-operations because of high harmonic voltage and/or current levels. This harmonic pollution is frequently send back onto the electric utility distribution system and might affect amenities on the same system which are more vulnerable.\n\n<strong>Few effects of voltage harmonics are:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Incorrect reading meters,</li>\n \t<li>Reduced true PF, where PF= Watts/VA.</li>\n \t<li>Overheated transformers will circulate in the primary side.</li>\n \t<li>Zero, negative sequence voltages on motors and generators.</li>\n \t<li>Nuisance operation of protective devices, including false tripping of relays and failure of a UPS to transfer properly, especially if controls incorporate zero-crossing sensing circuits.</li>\n \t<li>Blown fuses on PF correction caps because of high currents and voltage from resonance with line impedance.</li>\n \t<li>Mis-operation or failure of electronic equipment</li>\n \t<li>The effect on lighting is called flicker, if there are voltage subharmonics in the range of 1-30Hz.</li>\n \t<li>Distortion of unwanted currents, main supply voltage flowing in the supply network generate additional energy losses.</li>\n \t<li>Disturbed operation of florescent lamps, defective operation of regulating devices, television receivers or other equipment.</li>\n \t<li>Malfunction of ripple control and other mains signaling systems, protective relays and, possibly, other of control systems.</li>\n \t<li>Telephone interference.</li>\n \t<li>High harmonic amplitudes may not only cause malfunctions, additional losses and overheating, but also overload the power distribution network and overheat the neutral conductor and cause it to burn out.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\"><strong>Electrical component</strong></td>\n<td width=\"312\"><strong>Effects</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\">Conductor</td>\n<td width=\"312\">·         Current increase\n\n·         Resistance increase\n\n·         Increase in thermal loss (Joule’s effect)\n\n·         Skin Effect\n\n·         Cable heating\n\n·         Tripping of protection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\">Neutral Conductor</td>\n<td width=\"312\">·         Circulation of multiple of 3 harmonics\n\n·         Return through neutral conductor\n\n·         Overcurrent flowing in neutral\n\n·         Heating on neutral\n\n·         Premature degrading neutral conductor\n\n·         Neutral –earth voltage\n\n·         Tripping of protection</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\">Capacitors</td>\n<td width=\"312\">·         Parallel resonance with the system\n\n·         Harmonic gain\n\n·         Heating\n\n·         Premature aging of capacitors\n\n·         Capacitor destruction</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\">Transformers</td>\n<td width=\"312\">·         Current harmonics flowing through windings\n\n·         Overheating of the windings\n\n·         Thermal insulation loss due to heating\n\n·         Copper and Metal loss\n\n·         Reduction in performance\n\n·         Extra-large transformer\n\n·         Transformer saturation (creates greater distortion)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\">Motors</td>\n<td width=\"312\">·         Current harmonics flowing through\n\n·         windings\n\n·         Overheating of the windings.\n\n·         Thermal insulation loss due to heating.\n\n·         Copper and Metal loss (Hysteris and Foucault)\n\n·         Decrease in performance\n\n·         Vibrations on the axis, mechanical wear on\n\n·         bearings and eccentric bearings\n\n·         Torque reduction\n\n&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\">Power generating set\n\n&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"312\">·         Soft system, with greater impedance than the grid\n\n·         Distorted voltage\n\n·         Difficultly in automatic synchronisation and later switching\n\n&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"312\">Control and\n\nmeasuring equipment</td>\n<td width=\"312\">·         Invalid measurements\n\n·         Errors in control processes\n\n·         Error in equipment taking the zero reference of wave\n\n·         Saturation of measurement and/or protection measurement.\n\n·         Incorrect magnitude values\n\n&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n&nbsp;\n<h2>What is Done During Voltage Harmonics Study and Analysis?</h2>\nThe quantity of voltage harmonics will mostly be influenced by the source impedance, which includes all of the wiring and transformers back to the source of the electricity and the amount of harmonic currents being pulled by the load. Ohm’s Law is true for harmonic values as well. A “stiff” system, that is if the source harmonic impedance is very low, then the harmonic currents will result in lower harmonic voltages than if the source impedance were high.\n\n<strong>Comprehensive Harmonic Analysis Includes:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Predictive analysis for harmonic distortion</li>\n \t<li>Thorough report with recommendations</li>\n \t<li>Determine compliance with power quality standards - IEEE-519, IEEE 1547,  BS G5/4,  AS2279,  EN 61000-4-7</li>\n \t<li>Power factor analysis if needed</li>\n \t<li>Technical recommendations to solve or prevent power quality problems</li>\n \t<li>Analysis and reports follow IEEE-399 Guidelines</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Fourier Series:</strong> The analysis of harmonics is the means of computing the phases and magnitudes of the high order and fundamental harmonics of the periodic waveforms. The resulting series is known as Fourier series. It establishes a relation between a function in the domain of time and a function in the domain of frequency.\n\nThe Fourier’s theorem states that every non-sinusoidal periodic wave can be decomposed as the sum of sine waves through the application of the Fourier series, given the following conditions:\n<ul>\n \t<li>The integral over one period of the function is a finite value.</li>\n \t<li>The function possesses a finite number of discontinuities in a period.</li>\n \t<li>The function possesses a finite number of maxima and minima in a period.</li>\n</ul>\nThe Fourier series of a periodic function x(t) is expressed as:\n\nThis constitutes a representation of periodic function in the domain of the frequency.\n\nIn this expression, a0 is the average value of the function x(t), where an and bn are the coefficients of the series besides being the rectangular components of the n harmonic. For the corresponding n harmonic its vector is:\n\nWith a magnitude and an angle of phase:\n\n<strong>Hand-held Harmonic</strong> meters are used for performing spot checks for known harmonic problems. However, harmonic values will often change during the day, as different loads are turned on and off within the facility or in other facilities on the same electric utility distribution system. This requires the use of a harmonic monitor or power quality monitor with harmonic capabilities, which can record the harmonic values over a period of time.\n\n<strong>Harmonic Analysis Software</strong> can be used to simulate harmonic voltage sources and current, decrease nuisance trips, recognize harmonic problems, design and test filters, and report harmonic current and voltage distortion limit violations.\n\nComprehensive load flow and frequency scan calculations are performed using detailed harmonic source models and power system component frequency models. Outcomes are represented graphically involving harmonic spectrum plots, harmonic order and harmonic waveform plots.\n\n<strong>Complied Harmonic Standards:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>IEEE 519</li>\n \t<li>ANSI/IEEE 399</li>\n \t<li>IEEE 141</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>The main sources of harmonics are:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Arc furnaces and other elements of arc discharge, such as fluorescent lamps. Arc furnaces are considered as voltage harmonic generators more than current generators. Typically, all harmonics appear but the odd harmonics are predominant with typical values with regard to the fundamental harmonic:</li>\n \t<li>The third harmonic represents 20%, and the fifth harmonic represents 10%.</li>\n \t<li>The seventh harmonic represents 6%, and the ninth harmonic represents 3%.</li>\n \t<li>Magnetic cores in rotating machines and transformers need 3rd harmonic current to stimulate the iron.</li>\n \t<li>The inrush current of transformers produces second and fourth harmonics.</li>\n \t<li>Adjustable speed controllers used in fans, pumps, and process controllers.</li>\n \t<li>Solid‐state switches which modulate control currents, light intensity, heat, etc.</li>\n \t<li>Controlled sources for electronic equipment.</li>\n \t<li>Rectifiers based on diodes and thyristors for welding equipment, battery chargers, etc.</li>\n \t<li>Static reactive power compensators.</li>\n \t<li>DC high voltage transmission stations.</li>\n \t<li>AC to DC converters (inverters).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How is Voltage Harmonics Study and Analysis Performed?</h2>\n<strong>Following are the steps in voltage harmonic analysis of power transformer:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Draw the single line diagram of electrical installation</li>\n \t<li>Determine the characteristic of power transformer</li>\n \t<li>Indicate the load distribution</li>\n \t<li>Distortioners</li>\n \t<li>Non-distortioners</li>\n \t<li>Identify the measuring points and define each measuring points</li>\n \t<li>Determine whether the level of work demanded during measurements is known</li>\n \t<li>If yes, carry out measurements.</li>\n \t<li>If no, consult the owner</li>\n \t<li>Carry out the measurement for</li>\n \t<li>Supply/PCC: Check battery and note power. Perform the measurement with and without battery connected.</li>\n \t<li>Critical secondary switch boards: Determine the number of loads. Measure the neutral current and current imbalance.</li>\n \t<li>Distortioning loads: perform measurement on load. Perform measurement of different work regimes</li>\n \t<li>Interpret the data measured, aiming to recognize the effects harmonics produce on them.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Methods for Harmonic Mitigation:</strong>\n\nAfter the diagnosis and the assessment of the disturbances we move onto the treatment or solution. We must always look for a balance between the technical solution and the economic one. The ideal technical solution will be to filter directly the disturbing loads avoiding the propagation of the harmonic currents against other loads and installation, and a greater drop in harmonic voltage which would provoke the distortion of the voltage wave. In other cases, the solution is to look for a solution as near as possible to the loads.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong><u>Delta-Delta and Delta-Wye Transformers</u></strong>: This configuration uses two separate utility feed transformers with equal non-linear loads. This shifts the phase relationship to various six-pulse converters through cancellation techniques</li>\n \t<li><strong><u>Isolation Transformers</u></strong>: An isolation transformer provides a good solution in many cases to mitigate harmonics generated by nonlinear loads. The advantage is the potential to “voltage match” by stepping up or stepping down the system voltage, and by providing a neutral ground reference for nuisance ground faults.</li>\n \t<li><strong><u>Use of Reactors:</u></strong> It is a cheap and simple method to decrease the harmonics generated by non-linear loads and is an improved solution for harmonic decrease than an isolation transformer.</li>\n \t<li><strong><u>Passive Harmonic Filters (or Line Harmonic Filters)</u></strong>: Passive or Line harmonic filters (LHF) are also named as harmonic trap filters and are utilised to remove or control more leading, lower order harmonics particularly fifth, seventh, eleventh and thirteenth. LHF is comprised of a passive L-C circuit which is tuned to a specific harmonic frequency which needs to be mitigated.</li>\n \t<li><strong><u>12-pulse converter front end</u></strong>: In this the front end of the bridge rectifier circuit utilizes 12 diodes instead of 6. The advantages are the decrease of the fifth and seventh harmonics to a bigger order where the eleventh and thirteenth become the prevalent harmonics. This will reduce the amount of these harmonics but will not remove them.</li>\n \t<li><strong><u>18-pulse converter front end:</u></strong> An 18-pulse converter front end topology is involved of either a 3 phase to 9 phase isolation transformers or a lower cost patented design of 3 phase to 9 phase autotransformers, to produce a phase shift of ±20° necessary for the 18-pulse operation, and a 9-phase diode rectifier containing 18 diodes to convert 9 phase AC to DC.</li>\n</ul>\nIt is essential to follow the procedure for the study of the analysis of harmonic disturbance, if we omit any of the steps, the measurement and study process will be very complicating and, in many cases, we will be unable to give a possible solution to our solution.\n\n<strong>In short, the following should be carried out: </strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Define the objective of the study</li>\n \t<li>An electrical drawing of the installation and how the loads are distributed.</li>\n \t<li>To define measurement points and to identify them in the drawing</li>\n \t<li>Load level during measuring</li>\n \t<li>Interpret the data calculated trying to identify the effects of the harmonics and based on what the directive, standard or regulation establishes.</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "Infrared Scanning of electrical installations falls under classification of Predictive Maintenance Fault Finding.",
        "content": "Infrared Scanning of electrical installations falls under classification of Predictive Maintenance Fault Finding. The value is that we are now able to predict an electrical fault before the element fails completely.\n\nWe are able to get this due to the heat build-up of any electrical element under stress and predict that it will fail while it is still functional and appears normal to the naked eye or any other test equipment. The heat signature identified with the use of an Infrared camera. The pictures are then analysed and put into an easy-to-follow report so that they can rectify before a breakdown occurs, preventing loss of production due to unplanned down time.\n\nUnexpected breakdowns in electrical supply can inconvenient and costly. Infrared electrical thermography is a useful tool that can recognize stressed elements of your electrical installation before they break down or cause a fire. This gives you the opportunity to solve the problem as part of planned maintenance before it causes a serious problem.\n\nAnother result of failed or stressed electrical elements is the risk of fire; in fact the risk is more real than commonly realise. It is in this vein that insurance companies are increasingly calling for infrared electrical thermography surveys as a valuable risk assessment aid.\n\nIn the past this service was only available to very large companies and mining houses due to the cost determinant, but as with everything there have been massive advancements in the last few years and Thermo Scanning has now become a very profitable tool in the small to medium size business world.\n\nMaintenance includes vibration analysis on machines, audio, ultrasonic and infrared thermography inspection on electrical systems. Thermography used to recognize equipment hot spots. This task is typically carried out using temperature sensing instruments like thermocouple sensors or other forms of thermometers. Limitation of this analysis is that this kind of instrument can give maintenance personnel only with temperature readings on certain spots but not overall electrical system.\n\nThermography inspection generally uses infrared instrumentation to scan and create a temperature profile of intended targets.\n\nIn a typical manufacturing plant, Infrared thermography inspections did on electrical systems such as electrical switchboards, high-voltage distribution equipment motors, corresponding controllers, transformers and other control panels.\n<h2><b> Switchgear Thermography</b></h2>\nA great deal of investment is presently being made installation of thermal viewing ports for switchgear. These ports allow infrared inspections to carry out without removing switchgear covers, thus it would avoid worker arc-flash exposure. Installation of permanent infrared sensors and continuous infrared monitors are also reasonable methods for recognizing potential thermal failures of critical equipment. The principle of outdoor switchgear assemblies is often compromised by defective strip heaters. The strip heaters increase the switchgear temperature slightly above ambient to prevent condensation during daily or seasonal temperature changes. Functionality of these strips heaters and their effectiveness to carry out this duty can decide by carrying out thermal imaging of the switchgear enclosures. In other words, and once again, absence of heating identifies a potential problem.\n<h2><b> Benefits of Thermography Survey</b></h2>\nA major insurance carrier estimates that nearly 25 percent of all electrical failures attributed to faulty electrical connections. Therefore, many insurance firms are the driving force behind requiring facilities to conduct annual infrared surveys. Infrared technology has evolved into one of the most effective technologies for preventing failures and added benefit of not requiring an outage to carry out, as it can done on raw. Several further benefits of infrared technology listed below:\n\nHot spots such as loose connections and bad contacts.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Under-rated cables overheating under existing demand.</li>\n \t<li>Unbalanced loads.</li>\n \t<li>Stressed earth leakage units, circuit breakers, conductors and other electrical elements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>Infrared Electrical Thermography Survey Benefits</b></h2>\nAn infrared electrical thermography survey can result in significant financial savings for the client by:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Reducing the risk of an electrical fire.</li>\n \t<li>Reducing the risk of an unplanned electrical outage.</li>\n \t<li>Identifying priorities for planned maintenance, resulting in your spend going where it needed most.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Determines if the elements and system have been properly installed and are not damaged</li>\n \t<li>Reduces downtime</li>\n \t<li>Reduces risk of equipment failure</li>\n \t<li>Increases safety</li>\n \t<li>Improves insurability</li>\n \t<li>Reduces liability exposure of the designers and installers</li>\n \t<li>Improves system performance</li>\n \t<li>Determines elements and systems carry out properly and meet the design intent</li>\n \t<li>Determines if elements and systems compliance with the project specifications and design</li>\n \t<li>Reduces construction schedule delays</li>\n \t<li>Saves money</li>\n</ul>\n<b>Infrared Thermography Testing can be Done on</b>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Detecting loose or corroded electrical connections</li>\n \t<li>Detecting electrical unbalance and overloads</li>\n \t<li>Inspecting bearings and Electrical motors</li>\n \t<li>Inspecting steam systems IR Imaging helps  better to recognise and report suspect elements</li>\n \t<li>Enable the repair to done right the first time.</li>\n \t<li>High resistance connections</li>\n \t<li>Hot spots</li>\n \t<li>Over loaded cables</li>\n \t<li>Over loaded fuses or breakers</li>\n \t<li>Imminent motor or conveyor bearing failure</li>\n \t<li>Motor windings over heating</li>\n \t<li>Overheating in distribution equipment</li>\n \t<li>Phase load imbalance</li>\n \t<li>Hot spots in high level lighting</li>\n \t<li>Heat build-up in overcrowded trunking</li>\n \t<li>Thermal insulation breakdown (hot or cold)</li>\n \t<li>Thermal loss</li>\n \t<li>Damp ingress</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;",

        "content": "Arc Flash is an energy release that takes place when electricity flows through the air and two live conductors causing short circuit. In a residential setting, arc flashes usually produce little more than a brief flash of light before extinguishing themselves harmlessly. In commercial or industrial setting, voltages are high, so electrical faults usually release high energy. As a result, arc flashes in data centers routinely produce powerful explosions marked by searing heat, toxic fumes, blinding light, deafening noise and massive pressure waves.\n<h2><b>Human and Financial Repercussions of such Blasts can be Devastating</b></h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li><b>Injuries to employees: </b>Without adequate protection, workers exposed to arc flash events can suffer third-degree burns, collapsed lungs, vision loss, eardrum ruptures, puncture wounds, and even death. Literally, electrical contact results in 3,600 disabling injuries annually and one workplace death every day in the U.S., according to statistics from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li><b>Steep medical and insurance bills: </b>Covering the cost of an injured employee’s medical leave after an arc flash incident can expensive. Further, businesses experienced an arc flash may difficult to get insurance and probably pay higher rates for any coverage they do acquire until they can prove proper safety measures have taken.</li>\n \t<li><b>Exposure to fines and lawsuits: </b>Any time employees would die or get injured during the job, costly lawsuits are almost sure to follow. Unless, it is important to pay fines from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Literally, Occupational Safety and Health Administration has known to impose fines aggregating millions of dollars after arc flash events, and has even great companies that have yet to suffer arc flashes for failure to comply arc flash safety standards.</li>\n \t<li><b>Damage to equipment: </b>Arc Flash events are likely to damage any servers, racks, networking gear and power distribution units in their immediate vicinity. Smoke condensation can cause further harm to sensitive electrical equipment at greater distances. Also, should an arc flash trigger your data center’s fire suppression system? You can complete easily with an entire room of valuable IT resources covered in water or thick flame proof foam.</li>\n \t<li><b>Delays and downtime: </b>Companies sometimes must wait for Occupational Safety and Health Administration to complete an investigation before repairing arc flash-related damage. That means organizations with inadequately redundant data centers can get through hours, days or even weeks of downtime after an arc flash event.</li>\n \t<li><b>Impact on morale: </b>Attracting and retaining qualified technicians can difficult if an arc flash incident causes current and prospective employees to view your data center as an unsafe place to work.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>1. Perform a Hazard Analysis </b></h2>\nEvery Arc Flash reduction program should start by analysing risk aimed measuring how much energy an arc flash could release at various points along with power chain. Accuracy is essential with such measurements, so data centre managers who lack direct and extensive experience with arc flash incident energy assessment should always seek help from a qualified power systems engineer.\n\nBeginning with integration of an arc Flash risk analysis, companies should take the following steps:\n<ul>\n \t<li><b>Equip data center staff with proper Personal Protective Equipment: </b>Technicians should never come within range of a potential arc flash incident without wearing proper Personal Protective Equipment, such as flame-resistant clothing, eye protection and gloves. Personal Protective Equipment is available in different degrees of strength with different degrees of protection. Electrical engineers and fire safety professionals have developed two standards to help organizations analyse how much protection their employees need:</li>\n \t<li><b>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers 1584: </b>Created by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, one of the world’s most respected technical professional associations, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers 1584 offers guidance on quantifying potential arc flash incident energy levels.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li><b>NFPA 70E: </b>Produced by the National Fire Protection Association, a non-profit organization dedicated to fire, electrical, building and life safety, NFPA 70E defines thresholds for proper Personal Protective Equipment based on  severity of potential arc flash hazards. Drawing these two standards, data collected during an arc flash risk analysis, organizations can exactly analyse their risk factor, which would analyse what kind of Personal Protective Equipment their employees should wear while working in arc flash danger zones. Data centre managers should make sure that group from any vendors or third-party service who executes maintenance strategies on their server infrastructure wear exact Personal Protective Equipment at all times.</li>\n \t<li><b>Post warning labels. </b>To make sure data centre employees are always aware of potential arc flash hazards, companies should place warning labels on any piece of electrical equipment that poses an arc flash risk. They should record arc flash hazard zones on the floor so workers not wearing Personal Protective Equipment can clearly analyse how far from electrical equipment they must stand to avoid serious injury. Note that the NFPA 70E standard explicitly needs employers to post signage notifying employees of potential arc flash dangers. Organizations that ignoring this directive would dramatically increase their chances of paying serious fines and losing expensive litigation after arc flash incidents.</li>\n \t<li><b>Execute an employee training program. </b>To make sure data centre group understand arc flash dangers and know how to avoid them, be sure every existing and newly hired employee receives thorough arc flash safety training.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2> <b>2. Reduce Available Fault Current</b></h2>\nEven though it is not applicable to environments protection by fuses and electricity limiting breakers, data centers use Non-Current Limiting Breakers can decrease the risk of incident energy released during arc flashes by decreasing the amount of available fault electricity. The following four strategies can help data centers with NCLBs significantly reduce available fault current.\n\n<b>Operate with an open tie during maintenance: </b>Managing two electrical feeds helps data centers to increase repetition of their power supply, and availability of their IT systems. The downside of this power architecture, however, is that it doubles the amount of current available when faults occur. In most of the situations, opening the tie between dual power feeds during maintenance strategies decreases arc flash dangers by cutting available fault current in half.\n\nOf course, opening ties during maintenance also temporarily renders your power scheme less redundant, exposing IT equipment to heightened risk of failure. Given destructive human and financial toll arc flashes can take, most organizations trade-off worth making.\n\n<b>Switch to smaller kVA and/or higher impedance transformers: </b>In the past, server power supplies commonly generated distortion that could overheat electrical transformers. To satisfy, data centers often used bigger and hence stronger transformers than their infrastructure needed. These days, most server power supplies “power factor corrected,” so they no longer pose a risk to transformers. As a result, data centers can safely use smaller transformers suiting their needs. Following such method would save money and improve arc flash safety. As a smaller transformer releases less energy during faults, lowering the scale and impact of arc flash events.\n\n<b>Employ High-Resistance Grounding: </b>During ground faults, High-Resistance Grounding systems provide a path for ground current via a resistance that limits current significance. That greatly decreases the size of line-to-ground faults and associated arc flashes. High-Resistance Grounding can use on systems that service only three-phase loads. The U.S. National Electrical Code prohibits using High-Resistance Grounding on distribution systems serving loads that connected line-to-neutral, as are most servers. This limits practicality of High-Resistance Grounding system to the section of data center that powers cooling plants and other large three-phase loads.\n\n<b>Use current limiting reactors: </b>Current-limiting reactors act as a bottleneck on electrical flows, restricting electricity failures. For example, low-voltage motor control centers can supply with three single phase reactors that restrict available short circuit electricity, resulting in less energy releases when errors occur.\n<h2><b>3. Shorten Clearing Time </b></h2>\nJust a smaller arc flashes release less energy, to do shorter ones. There are three techniques for shortening arc flash events by decreasing fault clearance times:\n\n<b>Utilize Zone Selective Interlocking: </b>Zone Selective Interlocking is a security scheme that makes use of an “inhibit” signal transmitted from downstream breakers that see error to next breaker upstream. The upstream breaker analyse both the electricity failure and the inhibit signal and therefore delays tripping, allowing the downstream breaker to clear the fault. Should a fault occur between the downstream and upstream breaker, however, the downstream feeder doesn’t see the fault or send an inhibit signal to the upstream breaker. That causes the upstream breaker to bypass at any time, significantly decreasing arc flash incident energy.\n\n<b>Implement a bus differential scheme: </b>These integrated zones of protection within an electrical system. If any error take place between main and feeder breakers, then the protective devices trip immediately, Resisting arc flash durations while confining arc flash damage to specific portions of your infrastructure. Bus differential systems are typically faster and more sensitive than Zone Selective Interlocking, but need further current transformers and relaying equipment. This generally makes them harder to apply and more expensive.\n\n<b>Deploy an Arcflash Reduction Maintenance System: </b>An ArcFlash Reduction Maintenance System shortens faults by passing all time delays in the trip circuit at any time electricity exceeds maximal. That permits faults to clear even faster than a circuit breaker’s “instantaneous” function makes possible. Technicians must manually allow ArcFlash Reduction Maintenance System circuits before doing maintenance work and then disable them when work is complete, using familiar lockout strategies.\n<h2><b>4. Adopt Remote Operation </b></h2>\nExecuting probably dangerous strategies casually can safeguard data center group from injuries. There are two ways to resist the number of maintenance activity, technicians must execute while in range of ArcFlash blasts:\n\n<b>Install remote monitoring, control and diagnostics software: </b>Today’s sophisticated power management systems equip administrators to execute many administrative tasks remotely. They give companies to casually de-energize electrical equipment before data center staff approaches.\n\n<b>Use remote shaking devices: </b>Normally, technicians should stand close to equipment, electrical connections shake and un-shaking breakers. Remote shaking devices allow operators to execute these extremely dangerous tasks from a safe distance.\n<h2><b>5. Predict and Prevent Faults </b></h2>\nOne of the most effective ways to prevent arc flashes is to assume and ignore the conditions that cause them. The following three solutions permit data centers to spot possible ArcFlash risk before they have  chance to harm and keep group safely away from live connections.\n\n<b>Analyse insulation security: </b>Deteriorating insulations is the leading cause of electrical failures. Analysing and repairing insulation before it fails could avoid arc flash explosions. Anticipative maintenance systems give warning of insulation failure in medium voltage switchgear, substations, generators, transformers and motors.\n\n<b>Monitor pressure junctions: </b>Most of the electrical equipment has pressure junctions. Like, shipping splits, load lugs and compression fittings. Over time, vibration and thermal cycling can loosen these connections. When current flows through loosened connection, it cause overheating and ultimately produces an ArcFlash. Using non-conductors thermal sensors called pyrometers. Data centers can regulate pressure junctions regularly and receive advance notification of loose connections before they become very loose that they create an ArcFlash explosion.\n\n<b>Use infrared (IR) windows: </b>Using contactless IR thermography technology, IR windows enable technicians to execute IR scans without removing switchgear side panels, lessening the likelihood of arc flash events caused by accidental contact with live bus.\n<h2><b>6. Redirect Blast Energy </b></h2>\nEquipment that directs arc flash energy away from data center group is called “arc resistant.” Arc-resistant switchgear, for example, utilizes sealed joints, top-mounted pressure relief vents, and reinforced hinges to have the energy and heat released by arc flashes and channel them by ducts to vacant area inside or outside the data center.\n\nWhen all else fails, arc-resistant switchgear offers vulnerable data center employees a critical last line of defense from the explosive power of arc flash incidents. Anyhow, protective conditions said to effective only when equipment doors closed, it is important to train technicians to fasten doors safely while operating.\n\n<em><strong>Carelabs is authorized provider of Electrical Installation's Study, Analysis, Inspection, and Certification services in UAE, and offer arc flash study and analysis services.</strong></em>\n\n&nbsp;",

        "description": "Measurement of earth ground resistance for an earth electrode system should be done when the electrode is first installed, and then at periodic intervals thereafter.",
        "content": "Electrical safety testing is essential to ensure safe operating standards for any product that uses electricity. Various governments and agencies have developed stringent requirements for electrical products that are sold world-wide. Several tests are conducted to check the safety of products. One among that is earth test.\n\nPotentially the most dangerous appliances are Class I appliances (earthed appliances), example: microwave ovens/bench grinders and the like, but also in this category are extension leads. Class I appliances are designed to have a connection to the ground via an earth conductor. This may, or may not, be a suitable low resistance path for electric current to protect personnel and equipment. If this conductor is damaged anywhere then the consequences can be virulent.\n<h2>Why is Earth Ground Testing Needed?</h2>\nThe measurement of ground resistance for an earth electrode system should be done when the electrode is first installed, and then at periodic intervals thereafter. This ensures that the resistance-to-ground does not increase over time. The International Electrical Testing Association specifies ground electrode testing every three years for a system in good condition with average up-time requirements.\n\nPoor grounding not only increases the risk of equipment failure; it is dangerous too. Facilities need to have adequately grounded electrical systems so in the event of a lightning strike, or utility overvoltage, current will find a safe path to earth. Although the ground system when initially installed had low earth ground resistance values, the resistance of the grounding system can increase if the ground rods are eaten away by corrosive soils with high moisture content, high salt content, and high temperatures.\n\nIf our technician finds an increase in resistance of more than 20 percent, we will investigate the source of the problem and make the correction to the grounding system to lower the resistance.\n<h2>Factors That Can Change Your Minimum Earth Resistance</h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>A plant or other electrical facility can expand in size. Also, new plants continue to be built larger and larger. Such changes create different needs in the earth electrode. What was formerly a suitably low earth resistance can become an obsolete “standard.”</li>\n \t<li>As facilities add more modern sensitive computer-controlled equipment, the problems of electrical noise is magnified. Noise that would not effect cruder, older equipment can cause daily problems with new equipment.</li>\n \t<li>As more non-metallic pipes and conduits are installed underground, such installations become less and less dependable as effective, low-resistance ground connections.</li>\n \t<li>In many locations, the water table is gradually falling. In a year or so, earth electrode systems that formerly were effective may end up in dry earth of high resistance.</li>\n</ul>\nThese factors emphasize the importance of a continuous, periodic program of earth-resistance testing. It is not enough to check the earth resistance only at the time of installation.\n<h2>Factors Influencing Requirements for a Good Grounding System</h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Limiting to definite values the voltage to earth of the entire electrical system. Use of a suitable grounding system can do this by maintaining some point in the circuit at earth potential. Such a grounding system provides these advantages:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Limits voltage to which the system-to-ground insulation is subjected, thereby more definitely fixing the insulation rating.</li>\n \t<li>Limits the system-to-ground or system-to-frame voltage to values safe for personnel.</li>\n \t<li>Provides a relatively stable system with a minimum of transient over-voltage.</li>\n \t<li>Permits any system fault to ground to be quickly isolated.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n \t<li>Proper grounding of metallic enclosures and support structures that are part of the electrical system and may be contacted by personnel. Also to be included are portable electrically operated devices. Consider that only a small amount of electric current — as little as 01 A for one second — can be fatal! An even smaller amount can cause you to lose muscular control. These low currents can occur in your body at voltages as low as 100 V, if your skin is moist.</li>\n \t<li>Protection against static electricity from friction. Along with this are the attendant hazards of shock, fire and explosion. Moving objects that may be inherent insulators - such as paper, textiles, conveyor belts or power belts and rubberised fabrics - can develop surprisingly high charges unless properly grounded.</li>\n \t<li>Protection against direct lightning strokes. Elevated structures, such as stacks, the building proper, and water tanks may require lightning rods connected into the grounding system.</li>\n \t<li>Protection against induced lightning voltages. This is particularly a factor if aerial power distribution and communications circuits are involved. Lightning arresters may be required in strategic locations throughout the plant.</li>\n \t<li>Providing good grounds for electric process control and communication circuits. With the increased use of industrial control instruments, computers, and communications equipment, accessibility of low resistance ground connections in many plant locations — in office and production areas — must be considered.</li>\n</ul>\nResistance to earth can vary with changes in climate and temperature. Such changes can be considerable. An earth electrode that was good (low-resistance) when installed may not stay that way; to be sure, you must check it periodically. We cannot tell you what your maximum earth resistance should be. For specific systems in definite locations, specifications are often set. Some call for 5 Ω maximum; others accept no more than 3 Ω. In certain cases, resistances as low as a small fraction of an ohm are required.\n<h2>Nature of an Earth Electrode</h2>\nNature of an Earth Electrode Resistance to current through an earth electrode actually has three components:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Resistance of the electrode itself and connections to it.</li>\n \t<li>Contact resistance between the electrode and the soil adjacent to it.</li>\n \t<li>Resistance of the surrounding earth.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Electrode Resistance:</strong> Rods, pipes, masses of metal, structures, and other devices are commonly used for earth connections. These are usually of sufficient size or cross-section that their resistance is a negligible part of the total resistance.\n\n<strong>Electrode-Earth Contact Resistance:</strong> This is much less than you might think. If the electrode is free from paint or grease, and the earth is packed firmly, contact resistance is negligible. Rust on an iron electrode has little or no effect but if an iron pipe has rusted through, the part below the break is not effective as a part of the earth electrode\n\n<strong>Resistance of Surrounding Earth:</strong> An electrode driven into earth of uniform resistivity radiates current in all directions. Think of the electrode as being surrounded by shells of earth, all of equal thickness. The earth shell nearest the electrode naturally has the smallest surface area and so offers the greatest resistance\n<h2>Principles Involved in Earth Resistance Testing</h2>\nThe resistance to earth of any system of electrodes theoretically can be calculated from formulas based upon the general resistance formula:\n\n<strong>R = ρ LA</strong>\n\nWhere ρ is the resistivity of the earth in ohm-cm, L is the length of the conducting path, and A is the cross-sectional area of the path. All such formulas can be simplified a little by basing them on the assumption that the earth’s resistivity is uniform throughout the entire soil volume under consideration.\n<h3><strong>There are five basic test methods as noted below</strong></h3>\n<strong>Soil Resistivity Testing:\n</strong>Wenner four-pole equal method [19] has been considered in measuring the soil resistivity. The correct design of an earthing system is dependent upon detailed knowledge of the local ground resistivity. This is measured as a function of depth at a series of locations around the site, using an expanding four electrode Wenner array (BS EN 50522). The procedure is known as soil resistivity or earth resistance testing. Correct measurement is particularly important in areas of high resistivity ground, where electrical currents are not able to dissipate. In these conditions obtaining an earth can be problematic, and information on ground resistivity is required to much greater depths for the successful installation of an earthing system.\n\n<strong>Fall-of-Potential Method:\n</strong>With a four-terminal tester, P1 and C1 terminals on the instrument are connected to the earth electrode under test. With a three-terminal instrument, connect X to the earth electrode. Although four terminals are necessary for resistivity measurements, the use of either three of four terminals is largely optional for testing the resistance of an installed electrode. The use of three terminals is more convenient because it requires one lead to be connected. The trade-off is that the resistance of this common lead is included in the measurement. Normally, this effect can be minimized by keeping the lead short, to accommodate simple test requirements. The small additional resistance thus introduced is negligible. When performing more complex tests or meeting stringent requirements, however, it may be better to use all four terminals by a lead from the P1 terminal to the test electrode (connecting it inside the lead from C1). This is a true four wire test configuration which eliminates all lead resistance from the measurement.\n\nThe added accuracy may prove significant when meeting very low resistance specifications or using test methods that necessitate an extra digit of measurement in order to meet the mathematical requirements. The decision is optional, based on the operator’s testing goals and the method used. The driven reference rod C should be placed as far from the earth electrode as practical; this distance may be limited by the length of extension wire available, or the geography of the surroundings. Leads should be separated and “snaked,” not run close and parallel to each other, to eliminate mutual inductance. Potential-reference rod P is then driven in at a number of points roughly on a straight line between the earth electrode and C. Resistance readings are logged for each of the points.\n\n<strong>Dead Earth Method:\n</strong>When using a four-terminal instrument, P1 and C1 terminals connect to the earth electrode under test; P2 and C2 terminals connect to an all-metallic water-pipe system. With a three-terminal instrument, connect X to the earth electrode, P and C to the pipe system. If the water system is extensive (covering a large area), its resistance should only be a fraction of an ohm. You can then take the instrument reading as being the resistance of the electrode under test. The dead earth method is the simplest way to make an earth resistance test. With this method, resistance of two electrodes in series is measured — the driven rod and the water system. But there are three important limitations:\n<ol>\n \t<li>The waterpipe system must be extensive enough to have a negligible resistance.</li>\n \t<li>The waterpipe system must be metallic throughout, without any insulating couplings or flanges.</li>\n \t<li>The earth electrode under test must be far enough away from the water-pipe system to be outside its sphere of influence. In some locations, your earth electrode may be so close to the water-pipe system that you cannot separate the two by the required distance for measurement by the two-terminal method.</li>\n</ol>\nUnder these circumstances, if conditions 1 and 2 above are met, you can connect to the water-pipe system and obtain a suitable earth electrode. As a precaution against any possible future changes in the resistance of the water-pipe system, however, you should also install an earth electrode.\n\n<strong>Clamp-on Method:\n</strong>Fall-of-potential testing, and its modifications, is the only ground testing method that conforms to IEEE 81. It is extremely reliable, highly accurate and can be used to test any size ground system. Additionally, the operator has complete control of the test set-up and can check or proof his/her results by testing at different probe spacing. Unfortunately, the Fall of Potential method also comes with drawbacks:\n<ul>\n \t<li>It is extremely time consuming and labour intensive.</li>\n \t<li>Individual ground electrodes must be disconnected from the system to be measured.</li>\n</ul>\nThe clamp-on ground testing method, although it does not conform to IEEE 81, does provide the operator with the ability to make effective measurements under the right conditions. The clamp-on methodology is based on Ohm’s Law (R=V/I). A known voltage is applied to a complete circuit and the resulting current flow is measured. The resistance of the circuit can then be calculated. The clamp-on ground tester applies the signal and measures the current without a direct electrical connection. The clamp includes a transmit coil that applies the voltage and a receive coil that measures the current.\n\n<strong>Selective Measurement Testing:\n</strong>Selective testing is very similar to the Fall-of-Potential testing, providing all the same measurements, but in a much safer and easier way. This is because with Selective testing, the earth electrode of interest does not need to be disconnected from its connection to the site! The technician does not have to endanger himself by disconnecting ground, nor endanger other personnel or electrical equipment inside a no grounded structure.\n<h2>How to Improve Earth Resistance</h2>\nWhen you find that your earth electrode resistance is not low enough, there are several ways you can improve it:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Lengthen the earth electrode in the earth.</li>\n \t<li>Use multiple rods.</li>\n \t<li>Treat the soil.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Effect of Rod Size:\n</strong>As you might suspect, driving a longer rod deeper into the earth, materially decreases its resistance. In general, doubling the rod length reduces resistance by about 40 percent.\n\n<strong>Use of Multiple Rods:\n</strong>Two well-spaced rods driven into the earth provide parallel paths. They are, in effect, two resistances in parallel. The rule for two resistances in parallel does not apply exactly; that is, the resultant resistance is not one-half the individual rod resistances (assuming they are of the same size and depth).\n\n<strong>Treatment of the Soil:\n</strong>Chemical treatment of soil is a good way to improve earth electrode resistance when you cannot drive deeper ground rods because of hard underlying rock, for example. It is beyond the scope of this manual to recommend the best treatment chemicals for all situations. You have to consider the possible corrosive effect on the electrode as well as EPA and local environmental regulations. Magnesium sulfate, copper sulfate, and ordinary rock salt are suitable non-corrosive materials. Magnesium sulfate is the least corrosive, but rock salt is cheaper and does the job if applied in a trench dug around the electrode. It should be noted that soluble sulfates attack concrete, and should be kept away from building foundations. Another popular approach is to backfill around the electrode with a specialized conductive concrete. A number of these products, like bentonite, are available on the market.\n<h2>Effect of Temperature on Earth Resistivity</h2>\nNot much information has been collected on the effects of temperature. Two facts lead to the logical conclusion that an increase in temperature will decrease resistivity:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Water present in soil mostly determines the resistivity</li>\n \t<li>An increase in temperature markedly decreases the resistivity of water.</li>\n \t<li>The resistivity continues to increase as temperatures go below freezing.</li>\n</ul>\nGrounding testers are indispensable troubleshooting tools to help you maintain uptime. It is recommended that all grounds and ground connections be checked at least annually as a part of your normal predictive maintenance plan. Should an increase in resistance of more than 20% be measured during these periodic checks, the technician should investigate the source of the problem and make the correction to lower the resistance by replacing or adding ground rods to the ground system.",

        "description": "Explores over 5 Important things of arc flash hazard study and analysis that an engineering consultant typically performs. Preparing for the study in advance can make the process much easier and more accurate.",
        "content": "Arc flash study came into the picture ten years ago when IEEE 1584, known as “IEEE Guide for Performing Arc Flash Hazard Calculations,” was first introduced. This landmark document defines equations and methods that have become key components of the arc flash study.\n\nIn order to identify the specific arc flash hazard at a given piece of equipment within a facility, an arc flash study must be performed. There are several software packages available like ETAP, similar to short circuit study and coordination study software packages, to facilitate this analysis by a qualified professional electrical engineer.\n\nAn arc flash hazard study is a complicated engineering survey and analysis that typically is performed by an engineering consultant. Preparing for the study in advance can make the process much easier and more accurate. Although an arc flash study can be time-consuming, a correctly executed study can help improve plant safety by identifying where the most dangerous hazards are located and whether or not safety can be improved.\n<h1>What is an Electric Arc?</h1>\nAn electric arc is a luminous bridge formed in a gap between two electrodes. An Arc Flash occurs during a fault, or short circuit condition, which passes through this arc gap. The Arc Flash can be initiated through accidental contact, equipment that is underrated for the available short circuit current, contamination or tracking over insulated surfaces, deterioration or corrosion of equipment and, or parts, as well as other causes. An Arc Flash event can expel large amounts of deadly energy. The arc causes an ionization of the air, and arc flash temperatures can reach as high as 35,000 degrees Fahrenheit. This is hotter than the surface of the sun.\n\nThis kind of temperature can set fire to clothing and severely burn human skin in fractions of a second at a significant distance from the event. The heat can also result in the ignition of any nearby combustible materials. Arc Flash temperatures can also liquefy or vaporize metal parts in the vicinity of the event such as copper, aluminum conductors, or steel equipment parts. This material rapidly expands in volume as it changes state from a solid to vapor, resulting in explosive pressure and sound waves. The pressure wave can knock workers off balance or off ladders and even throw them across the room against walls or other equipment\n<h1>Why Arc Flash Study and Analysis is Important?</h1>\nThose involved with the design, implantation, and evaluation of electrical distribution systems must have an understanding of arc flash hazards and how to evaluate the hazards as well as minimize or mitigate the arc flash hazard to the electrical worker. In order to perform the arc flash study a short circuit and relay coordination study must first be performed or the results of these studies must be available to the engineer performing the arc flash study. At Carelabs, we use the tested and proven software ETAP to perform short circuit studies, relay coordination studies, and arc flash studies.\n\nThe result of the arc flash analysis will categorize the hazard at specific equipment based on the incident energy, as well as identify the Arc Flash Protection Boundary (this is the closest approach allowed before PPE must be worn). Inside the Arc Flash Protection Boundary, a worker must be wearing the proper clothing, or Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). The main objective of the PPE is to limit the burns to the body resulting from an arc flash event, to a survivable level. (i.e. .2nd degree or less).\n\nCarelabs provides complete arc flash engineering studies by performing a full, on-site assessment, arc flash modeling, equipment evaluation relative to the fault current, and clearing coordination of your system with detailed one-line electrical model drawings.\n\nWe offer excellent services and will support your site team, local electrical contractor, or engineering firm with any services you need. Our expertise is widely recognized in the industry and our engineers are members of IEEE, NFPA, and IEC which set the standards for arc flash studies. We can provide arc flash studies using the latest ETAP software.\n\nTailored results by Carelabs allow you to reduce the cost of the services you need without paying for those you don't need. We specialize in achieving fulfillment without excessive data and reports. These assessments are based on NFPA 70E, IEEE 1584, and NESC. Studies can be customized to include any and all of the following:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Fault current and coordination analysis</li>\n \t<li>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Level recommendations</li>\n \t<li>Arc Flash Equipment Labelling</li>\n \t<li>Arc Flash Incident Energy Mitigation Strategies</li>\n \t<li>Written Electrical Safety Programs</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>There are two factors that have made the arc flash study focus:</h2>\n<ol>\n \t<li>A greater understanding of arc flash hazards, and the risks they pose to personnel. Research into arc flash and arc blasts has begun to quantify the powerful forces they unleash.</li>\n \t<li>Increased vigilance on the part of OSHA. OSHA is using the requirements of NFPA 70E, the industry’s consensus standard for electrical safety, to judge whether the employer “acted reasonably” in protecting its workers from arc flash hazards. Noncompliance can result in substantial fines to employers.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>When is Arc Flash Hazard Study &amp; Analysis Needed</h1>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Arc Flash Analysis has not been performed in the past three years.</li>\n \t<li>Short-circuit, protective coordination studies have not been performed in the past five years.</li>\n \t<li>Changes have occurred to the electrical distribution system or electrical utility system.</li>\n \t<li>A safety audit is required or the facilities insurance policy is up for renewal.</li>\n \t<li>Modifications or expansions of the electrical distribution system are being considered.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>What are the Processes Involved in Arc Flash Analysis?</h1>\n<strong>Working within NFPA and IEEE guidelines, our experienced power systems engineers will perform an accurate systematic Arc Flash Hazard Study and analysis as follows:</strong>\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Short Circuit Calculations</strong> – ETS will either use your data or gather the data to make calculations for you to identify bolted and arcing fault levels at key points in a power distribution system.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Protective Device Coordination</strong> – ETS can perform an electrical systems coordination study or use the customer’s study, to determine the duration of the arcing faults.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Arc Flash Hazard Calculations</strong> – The incident energy level, the flash hazard boundary, and the PPE required are then calculated for each location.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Documentation</strong> – The information above is compiled for you into a comprehensive report, which contains information necessary to comply with regulatory requirements.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Unsafe Work Locations</strong> – The report will identify work locations having incident energy level in excess of available PPE ratings.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Arc Flash Hazard Mitigation</strong> – Recommendations will be made to minimize Arc Flash Hazards by changes in system protection or operational procedures.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Arc Flash Hazard Labels</strong> – In addition to the report, our customers will receive a field label containing the flash hazard boundary distance, incident energy level, and PPE category and shock category and shock hazard for each location.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Why is PPE Important?</h1>\n<strong>Even where engineering controls and safe systems of work have been applied, some hazards might remain. These include injuries to:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>The lungs, from breathing in contaminated air</li>\n \t<li>The head and feet, from falling materials</li>\n \t<li>The eyes, from flying particles or splashes of corrosive liquids</li>\n \t<li>The skin, from contact with corrosive materials</li>\n \t<li>The body, from extremes of heat or cold</li>\n</ul>\nThe purpose of personal protective equipment (PPE) is to protect individuals, exposed to health and safety hazards, from the risk of injury by creating a barrier against workplace hazards.\n<h2><strong>When selecting and using PPE:</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Choose products that are CE marked in accordance with the Personal Protective Equipment Regulations 2002 – suppliers can advise you.</li>\n \t<li>Choose equipment that suits the user – consider the size, fit, and weight of the PPE. If the users help choose it, they will be more likely to use it.</li>\n \t<li>If more than one item of PPE is worn at the same time, make sure they can be used together, for example wearing safety glasses may disturb the seal of a respirator, causing air leaks.</li>\n \t<li>Instruct and train people how to use it, example train people to remove gloves without contaminating their skin. Tell them why it is needed, when to use it, and what its limitations are.</li>\n</ul>\nIn order to correctly apply the NFPA 70E Hazard/Risk Category task tables, knowledge of the available short circuit current and the opening time of the overcurrent protective device is required.\n\nThe IEEE 1584 method is a systematic approach that calculates the exact arc flash energies from the electrical power system parameters. Carelabs services recommend a complete data collection from the power system in order to generate short circuit and coordination studies in addition to arc flash energy calculations.\n<h1>How do we Conduct an Arc Flash Hazard Study and Analysis?</h1>\n<h2><strong>The arc flash hazard study involves the following steps</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Step 1: Data Collection</strong></h3>\nThe initial steps are data collection and determining modes of operation. To perform an arc flash hazard analysis, data is collected about the facility's power distribution system. The data includes the arrangement of components on a one-line drawing (These are simplified drawings that show items such as circuit breakers, conductors, and power sources) with nameplate specifications of every device. Also required are details of the lengths and cross-section area of all cables. The utility should be contacted for information including the minimum and maximum fault currents that can be expected at the entrance. The modes of operation are used to study worst-case scenarios that may lead to arc flash, such as operations with circuit breakers open or closed or with certain motors or generators running or not running.\n\nAccurate electrical system drawings are necessary to identify power sources, voltage levels, electrical equipment, and protective devices. If you already have one-line diagrams, we will update the data and work from them, if possible\n\n<strong>Qualified staff must gather data from all applicable electrical equipment. Required information includes:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Data from the utility, including available fault current, operating voltage, and specifics regarding the utility’s protective equipment at the point of service.</li>\n \t<li>Specifics for each protective device in the electrical system, including manufacturer, model, available time/current settings, and short-circuit interrupting rating.</li>\n \t<li>Transformer impedance, tap settings, and ratings.</li>\n \t<li>Conductor specifics, including lengths, sizes, and types of all overhead lines, and buses.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Step 2: Engineering Analysis of the Data</strong></h3>\nOnce the data has been collected, a short circuit analysis followed by a coordination study should be performed. The resultant data can then be fed into the equations described by either NFPA 70E-2000 or IEEE Standard 1584-2002. These equations will produce the necessary flash protection boundary distances and incident energy to determine the minimum PPE requirement.\n\nA short circuit study is required to determine the magnitude of current flowing throughout the power system at critical points at various time intervals after a “fault” occurs. These calculations will be used to determine the bolted fault current, which is essential for the calculation of incident energy and interrupting ratings of your equipment. A bolted fault current occurs as a result of two conductors becoming joined together. The bolted fault and the arc fault currents are calculated with the use of the data from previous steps. Comparison of equipment ratings with calculated short circuit and operating conditions will identify underrated equipment.\n<h3><strong>Step 3: Protective Device Coordination</strong></h3>\nOnce the data is prepared and a flash hazard analysis has been performed, most likely it will be discovered that category 4 PPE will be required in most places. This is most unfortunate as this type of PPE is very unwieldy and could be costly in terms of time taken to perform work and the potential for mistakes. Prior to the new arc flash regulations, coordination studies were targeted at reliability with all settings adjusted towards the high side. Compliance with the new arc flash regulations means that not only does the coordination study need to be more accurate but it also needs to take into account the fact that the arc fault current is less than the bolted fault current. Protective device coordination should be performed to ensure selection and arrangement of protective devices limit the effects of an overcurrent situation to the smallest area. Results will be used to make recommendations for mitigation of arc flash hazards. Although this is an optional study, arc flash mitigation cannot be performed without completing this step. We perform this study in accordance with IEEE Std.\n<h3><strong>Step 4: Arc Flash Calculations</strong></h3>\nIn this step, we determine incident energies and flash protection boundaries, respectively, for all equipment. The incident energy is the energy needed for an arc flash to cause second-degree burns. The flash protection boundary is specified as the distance where the incident energy or second-degree burns are caused. These calculations are based on available short circuit current, protective device clearing time and distance from the arc. Calculations of incident energy levels and flash protection boundaries will be completed for all relevant equipment busses.\n<h3><strong>Step 5: Reporting</strong></h3>\nUpon completion of the calculations, we will prepare your Arc Flash Report. This will be supplied to you for a short review period, during which your team can review mitigation recommendations. At this point, we can hold a Management Summary meeting to interpret the report results. Upon approval, we will provide a final report and full-sized one-line diagrams, stamped by our Registered PE. The drawings and report will also be supplied to you in a digital format.\n<h3><strong>Step 6: Label Installation</strong></h3>\nWe will generate and install arc flash warning labels. These labels identify incident energy and working distance, nominal system voltage, and the arc flash boundary. In addition to standard requirements, our labels also include Limited, Restricted, and Prohibited approach boundaries, date, upstream protective device, and recommended personal protection equipment. We can also provide bolted fault current if desired\n<h1>Who Needs Arc Flash Analysis?</h1>\nMost commercial, institutional, and industrial electrical systems have arc flash hazards. OSHA requires that those systems be individually analyzed and, if hazards exist, labeled to identify the arc flash boundary. This will increase personnel safety, reduce shock hazards, and reduce arc flash injuries.\n\n<em><strong>Carelabs is an authorized provider of Electrical Installation Study, Analysis, Inspection, and Certification services in UAE, and offer arc flash study and analysis services.</strong></em>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",

        "content": "<h2>What is Automatic Transfer Switch?</h2>\nThe Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS) is a critical piece of equipment that alternates the origin or the source of power, typically between your utility power and backup/emergency power, ensuring your system’s ability to stay online. It is inherently important in making sure that this part of your emergency system is working properly. Also, because this particular part of your system is usually relatively complicated in nature, they are rarely examined or tested after the ATS has left its manufacturing facility. This is precisely why Industrial Tests, Inc. should be your first choice in ATS testing, so that you and your facility can feel safe and confident in its ability to transfer power, in the event of losing normal power. Automatic Transfer switch tests, tests utility power or standby generator power—and conducts the power to critical loads. The NFPA, Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), and all major ATS manufacturers publish literature calling for the monthly test of ATSs, yet many facility owners ignore these guidelines and refuse to perform the tests. There are good reasons for both the monthly-test requirement and for the reluctance of many operators to comply.\n\nNFPA 110, the standard for emergency and standby power supply systems, states “the monthly test of a transfer switch shall consist of electrically operating the transfer switch from the standard position to the alternate position and then a return to the standard position”. The standard also requires a monthly generator run. The best way to perform both these tests is by operating the test toggle on the ATS when the generator isn’t running, and confirming that the ATS properly signals the generator to start and run before transferring building load.\n<h2>Why Automatic Transfer Switch Testing is Done?</h2>\nMany critical electrical systems are not being maintained to the proper standard, and some are not maintained at all. Why? Maybe it's because electrical systems and components are being installed improperly. Maybe it's because of poor system design that leaves little access. Or maybe it's because many facility engineers still regard maintenance as a necessary evil. In order to evaluate the cost of maintenance, one must factor in the cost of lost service due to an unplanned failure plus the cost of replacement.\n\nThe automatic transfer switch (ATS) is a critical system component of the emergency power system, and proper maintenance of an ATS depends on the type of switch and its position in the critical power infrastructure. It is essential to find out whether your ATS is within manufacturers specifications during a planned examination, so that you don’t run the risk of finding this out during an unforeseen outage and you are unable to switch your system to its secondary power. Intermittent testing of your ATS is the sure-handed method of guaranteeing that your emergency system is as reliable as it can be. Our core group of technicians and engineers have been thoroughly educated and trained on emergency systems, particularly transfer switches. Combining our staff’s training with their vast experience in the field allows for an undeniable recipe for success, where our customers always seek out our expertise and services.\n<h2>The Three Primary Reasons for the Monthly Test</h2>\n<ol>\n \t<li>A test is an active demonstration that the EPSS is still able to function as intended. If a switch is going to fail to transfer, it’s better to have the switch fail while connected to a live normal source during a test than to have it remain connected to a dead normal source during an actual power outage.</li>\n \t<li>An automatic transfer switch is an electromechanical device with moving parts. Like the pistons and crankshaft in an automotive engine, the moving parts in an ATS can seize if they’re left in one position for months or years. Regular exercise will help ensure that moving parts will continue to operate smoothly.</li>\n \t<li>A transfer switch test transfers building load onto the generator for the duration of the generator test. Most standby power generators of more than 100kW are diesel engine driven, and all major diesel generator manufacturers recommend a load of at least 50% of maximum capacity during monthly generator tests. NFPA requires the same thing, for the simple reason that running under a light load is very bad for a diesel engine.</li>\n</ol>\nRunning a diesel generator in an unloaded condition—with no ATS transfer, thus with no building load connected—causes carbon buildup in the cylinders and exhaust system, a condition known as “wet stacking.” This problem reduces efficiency and power, and in extreme cases it can cause an exhaust system to catch fire. To reduce a wet-stack condition once it has developed, some facility owners will rent a resistive load bank and connect it to the standby generator for a full-load run of sufficient duration to “burn out” the build-up. The cost for such an exercise is substantial, and the relief provided is only temporary.\n<h2>Reasons Behind the Objection to Testing ATS</h2>\nSome people mistakenly think that monthly tests will shorten the life of a transfer switch, and are therefore reluctant to conduct them. More often, the reason for refusing to test properly is a fear of the two brief interruptions in power that an ATS test entails. There’s no truth to the idea of a regular test shortening the life of an ATS. Any device to be used as a transfer switch—switching a single electrical load between two sources of power—must comply with UL standard 1008, the only standard applicable to this duty.\n\nAny switch that bears a UL 1008 label can transfer a minimum of 3,000 times, with at least 1,000 of those operations under at least 100% of rated load. (For smaller ampacity switches 6,000 transfers must be under 100% load or greater). A switch that transfers back and forth each month will see 12 transfer operations per year, generally under something less than 100% of rated load. It would take a transfer switch at least 83 years to reach the same level of full-load use that representative switches endure in standard UL testing. And, as mentioned above, a switch that transfers regularly is less prone to seizure than a switch that has remained static for a long period.\n\nThe most-cited reason for failing to test transfer switches is that power interruptions can cause problems with lighting, transformers, computers, and other sensitive loads. It’s this fear, primarily, that causes many facility operators to conduct their monthly generator runs without switching building load onto the generator. While problems of this nature can be frightening, they should be no more frightening than the prospect of a transfer switch that fails to operate at a critical time due to lack of testing, or a generator that fails due to wet-stacking.\n<h3>There are several ways of mitigating or eliminating the problems caused by these power interruptions, both in new construction and in existing facilities:</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>For new construction projects the issue of transfer-test-caused interruptions in power is an easy one to solve. The engineer responsible for specifying the electrical equipment should specify “closed transition,” or make-before-break, transfer switches. A transfer switch of this kind transfers when in its test mode, with no interruption in power. Switches of this kind were once a special product available from only one manufacturer, and they carried a daunting price premium. Today, however, closed transition transfer switches (CTTS) are available from several manufacturers, and at a very modest price premium over the old-fashioned open transition switch.</li>\n \t<li>For existing facilities, a study should be done to determine which specific transfer switches feed loads that would actually suffer any negative impact from monthly interruptions in power. Those loads that are sensitive to interruptions can be protected with UPS systems, or with a timed pre-signal before transfer, allowing for orderly shutdown of the loads before power is interrupted. Also, existing open transition switches can be replaced with CTTS.</li>\n</ul>\nAny automatic transfer switch in an emergency or standby power system should be should be tested monthly in accordance with NFPA 110. That test should consist of an automatic generator start, initiated by the transfer switch, followed by an automatic transfer of facility load onto the standby generator. If power interruptions are a matter of concern, closed transition transfer switches should be used to eliminate the problem, or other methods should be used to mitigate the effects.\n<h2>What is Done During an Automatic Transfer Switch Test?</h2>\n<strong>Following steps are performed</strong>\n<ol>\n \t<li>Simulate loss of normal power.</li>\n \t<li>Return to normal power.</li>\n \t<li>Simulate loss of emergency power.</li>\n \t<li>Simulate all forms of single-phase conditions.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>ATS Checks Include</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Check wiring and connections are tight with no discoloration of metal, melted plastic and odour indicating excessive heat.</li>\n \t<li>Verify external operating mechanism is clean and re lubricate if found dirty.</li>\n \t<li>Check for any deterioration of wiring insulation such as cuts and abrasions. Replace or repair any damaged wiring.</li>\n \t<li>Check tightness of wiring connections. Retighten to specification if any loose wiring found.</li>\n \t<li>Perform insulation resistance tests on all control wiring with respect to ground.</li>\n \t<li>Perform a contact/pole-resistance test.</li>\n \t<li>Verify settings and operation of control devices.</li>\n \t<li>Calibrate and set all relays and timers.</li>\n \t<li>Verify phase rotation, phasing, and synchronized operation as required by the application. .</li>\n \t<li>Check ATS main power switching contacts condition.

This standard includes power sources, transfer equipment, controls, supervisory equipment, and accessory equipment. The standard also addresses installation, maintenance, operation, and testing requirements for these components of the emergency power supply system.\n\nTransfer switches are installed in the emergency power system to transfer the electrical load from the normal power source to the emergency power source (generator) upon failure of normal power. The transfer switch must transfer and retransfer the load automatically. Maintenance programs for transfer switches include checking of connections, inspection or testing for evidence of overheating and excessive contact erosion, removal of dust and dirt, and replacement of contacts when required. The maintenance procedure and frequency should follow those recommended by the manufacturer.\n\nIn the absence of manufacturer’s recommendations, NFPA 110 suggests visual inspection and cleaning annually. The 2005 edition of NFPA 110 further recommends an annual maintenance program including one major maintenance and three quarterly inspections. The major maintenance includes a thermographic or temperature scan of the automatic transfer switch. Automatic transfer switches must also be operated monthly. The monthly test consists of electrically operating the transfer switch from the standard position to the alternate position and then a return to the standard position.\n<h2>How ATS Testing is Done?</h2>\nATS is a pretty simple device. It senses power source and behaves according to how it's set up. Generally it defaults to generator, so with no power all 3 contacts, (30 amp) or 4 contacts, (50 amp) should measure closed and electricity will pass from one contact to the other.\n<h2>Summarized Procedure for Automatic Transfer Switch Testing and Maintenance</h2>\n<strong>Based on NETA Acceptance &amp; Maintenance Testing Standards, the process includes:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Contact to pole resistance test.</li>\n \t<li>Settings and operations verification.</li>\n \t<li>Control device Examinations.</li>\n \t<li>Manufacturer’s standards and specifications checks.</li>\n \t<li>Calibration services.</li>\n \t<li>Tap connections resistance measurements.</li>\n \t<li>Verifying engine start sequence.</li>\n \t<li>Time delay and retransfer functions checks.</li>\n \t<li>Mechanical parts inspections.</li>\n \t<li>Anchorage and groundings review for impairment or damage.</li>\n \t<li>Corresponding parts are properly lubricated and clean of debris or contaminants and more.</li>\n</ul>\nAutomatic transfers should operate in accordance with manufacturer's design. For more detail on these tests, see the ATS functional testing procedure described below. A general procedure for functional testing of an automatic transfer switch and standby generator is described below.\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em><strong>Step 1:</strong></em> To begin the test, close the normal source circuit breaker. The switch controller will illuminate the Utility Available LED (if equipped) when correct voltage is sensed. If the ATS mechanism is set on Source 1, the Source 1 position LED will also light. Verify the phase to phase voltages at the utility line terminals.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em><strong>Step 2:</strong></em> Next, close the Alternate source breaker and start the engine generator. The S2 (Alternate) Available LED will illuminate when correct voltage and frequency levels are sensed. After both sources have been verified, shut down the engine generator, and put the generator's start control in the automatic position.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em><strong>Step 3:</strong></em> Simulate a utility outage by opening the Source 1 (normal side) breaker. The delay to engine start timer begins its timing cycle. After the timer has completed its timing cycle, the engine start contacts close to start the generator.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em><strong>Step 4:</strong> </em>When generator voltage and frequency reach the preset restore points the Source 2 Available LED illuminates. Simultaneously, the delay to generator timer begins its timing cycle. When the time delay is completed the ATS will transfer to Generator, the S1 position LED goes off, and the S2 position LED illuminates. Systems shall transfer in no less than 10 seconds where failure of the equipment to perform could result in loss of human life or serious injuries.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em><strong>Step 5:</strong></em> Reclose the Source 1 breaker to re transfer to the normal source. The delay to utility timer begins its timing cycle. When the timer has completed its timing cycle, the ATS will transfer. The S2 position LED goes off, and the S1 position LED illuminates.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em><strong>Step 6:</strong> </em>The delay engine stop timer will begin its timing cycle. The generator runs unloaded for the duration of this timing cycle. When the timer completes its timing cycle, the generator will stop. The S2 Available LED goes off. A minimum time delay of 5 minutes should be provided for unloaded running of the EPS prior to shutdown to allow for engine cool down (NFPA 110). The minimum 5-minute delay is not required on small air-cooled prime movers 15 kW or less.</p>\nApply a field testing label in accordance with NFPA standards indicating that the transfer switch is electrically and mechanically sound and suitable for service after completing all tests.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhether you are looking for routine maintenance, or wanting to troubleshoot ATS failure or have emergency systems queries, contact Carelabs at <strong><a href=\"tel:+9714514%209730\">971 4 514 9730</a></strong> or <a href=\"tel:+971557921054\"><strong>+971 55 792 1054</strong> </a>(Call or WhatsApp) or email at <strong><a href=\"mailto:info@carelabz.com\">info@carelabz.com</a></strong> .

Your systems are valuable and circuitry needs to be maintained for the durability and functionality of your business. In most homes, basic shock protection is done by organising an earthing circuit with automatic switches in the indoor wiring circuits.  This quickly cuts off supply to an earthing circuit where a fault occurs and touch voltage exceeds an acceptable limit. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nAccording to the current national safety standards, you are required to conduct loop impedance test on your premises to ensure the safety of all guests and employees. The electrical earth of all your electrical installations and power points has to be tested to discover any faults within your electric circuit. Having a functional earth return circuit will allow the detection of circuit faults and facilitate a reaction from your MCB (miniature circuit breaker). Carelabs technician will detect the resistance level in your earth return circuit and notify you if it is at the wrong level – it needs to be low enough to allow the circuit breaker to function correctly. Carelabs will inspect and test your electrical wiring and by asking us to test you are protecting both your employees and your liability. It is important to adhere to national legislation to avoid harsh penalties.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nThe required values of impedance and time will change dependent upon the type of installation (TN/TT etc.) and the type of protection, whether it be a miniature circuit breaker (MCB), cartridge fuse or re-wireable fuse for example. The fault current can either be in the Line-Neutral or Line-Earth circuit, so there is a need to confirm the loop impedance of each<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>What is Done During Earth Fault Loop Impedance Testing?</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\nIt is generally accepted that, where the measured earth fault loop impedance of a circuit is not greater than 80% of the relevant limit specified in BS 7671, the impedance can be expected to be sufficiently low under earth fault conditions to meet the relevant limit specified in BS 7671, and for the protective device to automatically disconnect within the time specified.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nProper protection against electric shock hazards is given when the TT wiring system complies with: <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\n<strong>Ra x Ia &lt;50, </strong>\n\nWhere “Ra” is the sum of the resistances of earth bars and protective conductors and “Ia” is the maximum current of the protection system.

Using a test current of up to 20 A and a simple 2 wire connection, it is by and large the fastest, most accurate test available on a day to day basis. Most standard loop impedance testers will incorporate this type of test. Because of the relatively high test current, the readings are not generally influenced by external factors and will return repeatable, stable readings in most scenarios.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h3><b>2-wire “No-Trip” dc saturation test</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\nA DC test current was injected in to the circuit prior to carrying out a standard 2 wire high current test. The aim of this DC test was to saturate the monitoring coil within the RCD, allowing enough time for the high current AC test to be carried out. However, due to the increase in electronic RCDs, this method now has limited applications<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h3><b>3-wire “No-Trip” test </b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\nThis test method overcame the need to by-pass even the new electronic protection devices by utilising a low current Line-Earth test current, whilst still returning a degree of accuracy. Not having to by-pass the RCD/RCBO obviously introduced a time saving factor. In addition, by having the requirement of connecting to Line, Neutral and Earth, the testers were now able to confirm the presence of all three as well as indicate if there was a reverse polarity at the test point and, due to the limited test current, there was no issue with tripping the MCB.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h3><b>2-wire “No Trip” test</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\nThey allow testing most RCDs and RCBOs without having to bypass them. With no neutral connection required, they maintain a true 2-handed operation, but will no longer indicate reverse polarity or warn of a missing neutral. Although the physical test time is similar to that of the 3-wire method, the time saving of not having to bypass the RCD still makes for a more efficient test.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h3><b>4-wire grid impedance test</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\nThe test uses a 4 wire Kelvin connection, negating internal lead and contact resistance; such is the accuracy of the test. With test currents up to 1000 A, measurements down as low as 10 MOhm can be accurately made. Consequently, there is no “No-Trip” option with this test method. With specific applications being measurement in sub-station/switch room environments, this tester gives the test engineer the ability to take accurate readings.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nA circuit protected by an RCD will need special attention, because the earth-fault loop test will draw current from the phase which returns through the protective system. Thus testing of circuits protected by RCDs has presented instrument manufacturers’ with difficulties in providing test results similar to that of the testing of non-RCD protected circuits, without tripping the RCDs during the tests. Therefore, any RCDs must be bypassed by short circuiting connections before earth-fault loop tests are carried out. It is, of course, of the greatest importance to ensure that such connections are removed after testing.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nAt Carelabs we use an earth loop impedence tester that will not trip out the circuits RCD that we are testing. Our team will conduct all tests and inspections according to the current safety standards.

Further investigation revealed that the problem appeared to be mainly with the low test currents, caused by variations in power supply quality created by voltage magnitude, transients, harmonics etc. Similar tests carried out using a stabilised power supply with a clean 50Hz waveform produced more consistent results. It should however, be noted that these discrepancies, usually in the order of 1.0Ω or less, are not significant in terms of the correct operation of an RCD. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nAfter testing is complete, we will give you a retest date (for your next earth loop impedance test) that complies with the national standards.

Earth loop impedance testing is essential since if a live conductor is accidentally connected to an earth conductor in a faulty appliance or circuit, the resulting short-circuit current to earth can easily be high enough to cause electric shock or generate enough heat to start a fire. Normally, the fuse will blow or another circuit protection device will trip, but a situation may arise where the actual short-circuit current in a faulty installation is of insufficient level and the protection device would thus take too long to activate. The delay can be disastrous for life and property. It is therefore necessary to know if the impedance of the path that any fault current would take is low enough to allow sufficient current to flow in the event of a fault and that any installed protective device will operate within a safe time limit. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>",

Emergency power generation systems fall under a number of regulatory oversight conditions and code requirements. The National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) and the National Electric Code (NEC) have both drafted rules which pertain directly to the load bank testing of emergency generators.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>Why is Generator Load Bank Testing Done?</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></h2>\nYour generator set is a valuable resource that provides a dependable emergency power to your business when power from the utility grid is suddenly lost, or power is not available in your environment. In the event of a power failure you want to have peace of mind that your backup power supply will spring into action seamlessly on a moment's notice. But what happens when the power goes out and your generator fails function as expected? The result can often be costly and sometimes catastrophic depending upon your application. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:150,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nThis is precisely the reason generator load bank testing is an essential piece of a comprehensive preventative generator maintenance plan, which you should ideally have conducted on your genset(s) each year. Load bank testing helps to ensure that your generator will be fully dependable and operational, as well as completely capable of the highest possible load it may be required to handle at any critical point in time. Load testing your emergency standby generator system should be part of a standard planned maintenance program for all systems.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:150,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>Reasons to Test Your G</b><b>enerator</b></h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"2\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\">To make sure the generator will perform as designed, when it is needed most. This is the only true way to check the performance of the generator. A load test will allow verification that the generator system will produce and maintain full load without overheating and shutting down. It also allows testing of all components of the system, to ensure all work together as designed and intended and can help identify any potential weaknesses in controlled conditions. This allows proactive maintenance, as weaknesses are identified during controlled conditions, not during a utility outage when a weakness can cause the system to fail.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\n</span>The load can come from building load, but that may cause business interruptions when transferring from utility to generator.

That challenge is referred to as wet-stacking. If not addressed, wet-stacking will degrade the performance of the system and not allow the system to operate as designed. Many systems are designed with some redundancy on load or for future expansion. This means many systems are not loaded appropriately to eliminate wet-stacking. At a minimum, I recommend all diesel system be load tested with a portable load bank for a minimum of two hours, annually. If a diesel system hasn't been load tested in over a year, longer testing may be required. This annual testing will reduce the impact wet-stacking will have on a generator system.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></li>\n</ul>\nA good planned maintenance program that includes regular load testing should be a standard component of a generator system.

The equipment used to conduct a load bank test produces artificial loads on the generator by bringing the engine to an appropriate operating temperature and pressure level. This is especially important for standby and emergency generator sets that do not run very often and/or may not be exposed to carrying heavy loads on a frequent basis.  The general rule is - if your generator is not exposed to higher than 30% of its rated kW load then you should be considering a load test.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nLoad bank testing involves firing up a standby or prime power generator and running it under an artificial load at its maximum capacity for a specified period of time. During load bank testing, data can be recorded that offers a more thorough look into the health of the gen set on the whole. The test verifies that the generator is capable of handling incrementally higher kW loads, that it is still capable of accommodating its maximum specified load, and that it can work for an extended period of time. So, at its simplest, load bank testing is a way of verifying that your standby or prime power generator is still capable of kicking on and operating at its maximum kW output.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nA load bank test ensures that your generator will run property when it’s needed so that you can fully depend on it during an emergency situation. The key to a proper load bank test is that it tests your generator at its full kilowatt (kW) output rating. Because many generators do not regularly operate at their full kW rating, it's especially important that you verify your generator can actually produce the highest possible horsepower that may be required - while at the same time maintaining adequate temperature and pressure levels that will allow it to run as long as necessary.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nThe recommended procedure to follow for the load bank test would be to:<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:360,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Start and run the generator until the water temperature stabilizes.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:360,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li>Transfer all manual or automatic transfer switches to the emergency source.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:360,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li>Step load the generator with the load bank until the desired load is reached.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:375,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li>Remove the load bank load first, after the test.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:375,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li>Transfer all transfer switches back to the normal position.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:375,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li>Allow the generator to cool down according to manufacturers’ guidelines.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:375,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></li>\n</ul>\n<strong>It will be discussed in detail in the following section. </strong>\n\nCarelabs can help in designing the proper planned maintenance program for your standby generator system, and our team of factory trained technicians will make sure your planned maintenance will be carried out skilfully and any issues found will be brought to your attention immediately, ensuring you are prepared for the next interruption in utility power.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n<h3><b>Load Banks:</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></h3>\nLoad Banks are electrical devices that are temporarily wired into a generators AC voltage output.

The primary effect is the result of electrical current passing through the human body. Severity of the injury to the human body is directly affected by such variables as: the nature of the electrical voltage (AC vs. DC); the pathway through the human body; conductivity of the contact (wet or dry); the size and shape of the individual involved i.e., the person’s impedance), duration of the contact, and the size of the contact area. All these affect the magnitude of current that flows through the person’s body.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:254}\"> </span>\n\nMost safety standards address the shock issue by incorporating requirements that instructs appropriate product enclosures: connectors that do not allow direct user access, good dielectric or insulating barriers, as well as very low leakage current. Not all voltage potentials, however, are considered hazardous. Some are considered safe for user contact because of the low levels at which they operate. Since the standards are very specific about these limits, manufacturers must be careful to test their products against the right product standard to be sure that the products are safe.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:254}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>Why Electr</b><b>ical Safety Testing is Done?</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:254}\"> </span></h2>\nTesting electrical and electronic products for electrical safety is intended to identify the potential risk of electrical shock to users. It is a statutory obligation in most cases. <b>If your premises are open to the public</b>, i.e. pubs, schools, cinemas, clubs, churches, dentists, doctors etc. then you most likely <b>need to be inspected yearly</b>.

This is a high-voltage test that is applied to all devices for a specific time in order to ensure that the insulation is not marginal. Hipot tests are helpful in finding nicked or crushed insulation, stray wire strands or braided shielding, conductive or corrosive contaminants around the conductors, terminal spacing problems, and tolerance errors in cables. It guarantees no current flows from one point to another point.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:254}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:254}\"> </span>HiPot test is opposite of continuity test. Continuity Test checks surety of current flows easily from one point to another point while Hipot Test checks surety of current would not flow from one point to another point (and turn up the voltage really high just to make sure no current will flow).<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:254}\"> </span>\n\nHipot testers usually connect one side of the supply to safety. The other side of the supply is connected to the conductor being tested. With the supply connected like this there are two places a given conductor can be connected: high voltage or ground. When you have more than two contacts to be hipot tested you connect one contact to high voltage and connect all other contacts to ground. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:254}\"> </span>\n\nTesting a contact in this fashion makes sure it is isolated from all other contacts. If the insulation between the two is adequate, then the application of a large voltage difference between the two conductors separated by the insulator would result in the flow of a very small current. Although this small current is acceptable, no breakdown of either the air insulation or the solid insulation should take place. Therefore, the current of interest is the current that is the result of a partial discharge or breakdown, rather than the current due to capacitive coupling<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:254}\"> </span>\n\n<strong>Steps to be followed during HiPot tests are: </strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Only electrically qualified workers may perform this testing.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:254}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li>Open circuit breakers or switches to isolate the circuit or Cable that will be hi-pot tested.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:254}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li>Confirm that all equipment or Cable that is not to be tested is isolated from the circuit under test.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:254}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li>The limited approach boundary for this hi-pot procedure at 1000 volts is 5 ft.

After the required connections are made, you apply the test voltage for a period of one min. (The one-min interval is an industry practice that allows everyone to take the reading at the same time. In this way, comparison of readings will be of value because, although taken by different people, the test methods are consistent.) During this interval, the resistance should drop or remain relatively steady. Larger insulation systems will show a steady decrease, while smaller systems will remain steady because the capacitive and absorption currents drop to zero faster on smaller insulation systems. After one min, read and record the resistance value.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:254}\"> </span>\n\nThe Insulation Resistance Test consists in measuring the Insulation resistance of a device under test, while phase and neutral are short circuited together.

If the equipment is not properly grounded, the current flows through other paths such as the human body. The difference between leakage current test, withstanding voltage test and grounding protection test is the process of testing an equipment under running status. Whatever be the national standard regulation or region standard regulation, the standard of leakage current is different depending on the insulation types of products. “CLASSI, II, III” (which derived from IEC system) A brief descriptions is given below: <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:254}\"> </span>\n<ul>\n \t<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"14\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\">CLASS I indicates anti-shock protection of product not only depends on basic insulation but also includes grounding method. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:254}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"14\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\">CLASS II indicates anti-shock protection of product not only depends on basic insulation but also includes additional precaution.

A person typically perceives current flow through his body when it reaches or exceeds 1mA (one thousandth of an ampere). Current above the threshold can cause an uncontrolled muscular spasm or shock. The leakage current is measured by applying a fixed voltage and measuring the voltage across the shunt that is a result of the leakage current. The reference design uses different switchable shunt resistances, which are switched on in a sequence to measure the insulation resistance. When there is a dead short, the insulation resistance is 0 Ω and a full current (or maximum) can pass through the insulation resistance. At this point in the measurement having a smaller shunt value (by turning on all of the switches) is mandatory. In the other case, when the insulation is higher, a higher shunt value is required. The leakage current flowing through the shunt or shunts is measured using a current shunt monitor<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:254}\"> </span>\n<h2>How to Select the Correct Safety Test Equipment</h2>\nThe first step to select safety test equipment is to realize your basic requirement, it may be the safety standard your company product need to accord.

The ohmmic value of the insulation resistance is expressed in megohms (MΩ). To conform to specific standards, the insulation resistance test can be performed under voltages up to 1500VDC.

This is a portable tool that is more or less an ohmmeter with a built in generator that’s used to produce a high DC voltage. The voltage usually measures at least 500V, and causes a current to flow around the surface of the insulation. This gives a reading of the IR in ohms.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nInsulation resistance measurement is based on Ohm's Law. (R=V/I). By injecting a known DC voltage lower than the voltage for dielectric testing and then measuring the current flowing, it is very simple to determine the value of the resistance. In principle, the value of the insulation resistance is very high but not infinite, so by measuring the low current flowing, the megohmmeter indicates the insulation resistance value, providing a result in kW, MW, GW and also TW (on some models). This resistance characterizes the quality of the insulation between two conductors and gives a good indication of the risks of leakage currents flowing. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nWell, if you are looking at a high number of IR, you have some good insulation.

Its operation, particularly to measure resistance, is given by the action of an internal battery (low voltage) that circulates a small current through the resistance being measured or, failing that, the conductor or winding. The value in ohm obtained belongs to the electrical resistance, which causes the current to pass through the conductor and is incremented according to its longitude and section.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:150,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nOn the other hand, a megohmeter, also known as Megger, is often used to measure the insulation resistance of an insulated body. For its operation, it uses a DC generator or a battery, are able generate output voltage values of up to 5000V. The results obtained in the ohm test are related to the insulation resistance, which has an insulated element relating to an active element or a conductor.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:150,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nAlthough there is a degree of similarity between both tools, the insulation resistance is mandatorily measured using a Megger (or a similar device), because it’s able to generate a high voltage that creates a moment of stress in the insulation.  Insulation resistance is calculated usually in Mega- or Tera-ohms, inclusive<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:150,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nIn conclusion, a multimeter measures the electrical resistance of a conductor (coil), while a Megger measures the insulation resistance of an isolated group (two coils relative to mass), something that a multimeter is unable to do.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:150,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>Types of Insulation Resistance Tests </b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></h2>\n<b>Short-Time or Spot-Reading Test</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\n</span>In this method, you simply connect the Megger instrument across the insulation to be tested and operate it for a short, specific time period you have simply picked a point on a curve of increasing resistance values; quite often the value would be less for 30 seconds, more for 60 seconds. Bear in mind also that temperature and humidity, as well as condition of your insulation affect your reading.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nIf the apparatus you are testing has very small capacitance, such as a short run of house wiring, the spot reading test is all that is necessary. For many years, maintenance professionals have used the one-megohm rule to establish the allowable lower limit for insulation resistance. The rule may be stated: Insulation resistance should be approximately one megohm for each 1,000 volts of operating voltage, with a minimum value of one megohm.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\n<b>Time-Resistance Method </b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">\n</span>This method is fairly independent of temperature and often can give you conclusive information without records of past tests. It is based on the absorption effect of good insulation compared to that of moist or contaminated insulation. Tests by this method are sometimes referred to as absorption tests.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nThis test is of value also because it is independent of equipment size.

        "content": "A Lightning Arrester, Surge arrester or Line arrester is a device used on electrical power systems and telecommunications systems to protect the insulation and conductors of the system from the damaging effects of lightning. The typical Lightning Arrester has a high-voltage terminal and a ground terminal. When a lightning surge (or switching surge) travels along the power line to the Arrester, the current from the surge is diverted through the Arrestor, in most cases to the earth.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nWithout good earth connections, even the most sophisticated of building lightning protection installations will be ineffective. However, the only way to ensure that the earth connections really are good is to test them. If protection fails or is absent, lightning that strikes the electrical system introduces thousands of kilo Volts that may damage the transmission lines, and can also cause severe damage to transformers and other electrical or electronic devices.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>What is a Lightning Arrester/Surge Arrester?</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\nSurge arresters are devices that help prevent damage to apparatus due to high voltages. The arrester provides a low-impedance path to ground for the current from a lightning strike or transient voltage and then restores to a normal operating conditions. A surge arrester may be compared to a relief valve on a boiler or hot water heater. It will release high pressure until a normal operating condition is reached. When the pressure is returned to normal, the safety valve is ready for the next operation. When a high voltage (greater than the normal line voltage) exists on the line, the arrester immediately furnishes a path to ground and thus limits and drains off the excess voltage. The arrester must provide this relief and then prevent any further flow of current to ground. The arrester has two functions, it must provide a point in the circuit at which an over-voltage pulse can pass to ground and second, to prevent any follow-up current from flowing to ground.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nVarious types of surge voltages can occur in electrical and electronic systems. They differ mainly with respect to their duration and amplitude. Depending on the cause, a surge voltage can last a few hundred microseconds, hours or even days. The amplitude can range from a few millivolts to some ten thousand volts. Lightning strikes are a special cause of surge voltages. Direct and indirect strikes can result not only in high surge voltage amplitudes, but also particularly high and sometimes long current flows, which then have very serious effects<span

Furthermore special applications for surge arresters, such as protection of gas insulated substations and prevention of lightning faults in transmissions lines, are now taken into consideration by several utilities. The evolution of surge arrester construction technologies and application requires a continuous revision of relevant standards and testing techniques. CESI has been actively involved in testing surge arresters since the 1960s, through the development and setting up of testing facilities and the participation to the major technical and standardization bodies. The paper analyses the most important aspects relevant to surge arrester testing, based on the most recent experience developed in CESI. Particular attention is focused on the short circuit test techniques to address the failure mode and on the ageing test procedures to investigate the long term performance of surge arresters.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>What is Done During Lightning Arrester Testing?</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\nProtective measures against lightning strike events are stipulated in lightning protection standard IEC 62305.

Even the largest MOV arresters, e.g. 4 to 5 meters in height, dissipate less than 50 watts. With an arrester of that length, this does not create a visible temperature rise and makes any effort to measure temperature gradient above ambient a challenge.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\n<strong>The benefits of thermal imaging are significant: </strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Speed of data collection. Indeed, there is no faster way at present to tell if an arrester is near end-of-life than a scan of its temperature. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li>Accuracy from a distance is also excellent, especially if using a long-range camera lens. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n</ul>\nThe risk that an arrester is in the process of failing without also generating some heat is very low. At the same time, if an arrester is damaged by lightning strike or switching surge only days after its last thermal scan, it may well fail before the next scheduled scan. This potential for failure between successive scans is perhaps the only major negative of thermal imaging. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>Power Factor Testing of Lightning Arrestor</b></h2>\nPower factor testing is extremely sensitive to weather conditions. Tests is conducted in favourable conditions whenever possible. Measurements on surge arresters are always performed at the same or recommended test voltage since nonlinear elements may be built into an arrester. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nExcept for the specific purpose of investigation surface leakage, the exposed insulation surface of an arrester is kept clean and dry to prevent leakage from influencing the measurements. Extreme care is taken when handling arresters suspected of being damaged, since dangerously high gas pressures can build up within a sealed unit. The test mode and the number of tests performed will depend on the number of arresters in the stack. After performing tests, the test results are recorded on a test form.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nFor all power factor testing, the more information recorded at the time of testing will ensure the best comparison of results at the next routine test. Test data should be compared to factory or nameplate data if available. If no data is available, compare the test results to prior tests on the same arrester and results of similar tests on similar arresters. The following additional information should be recorded on the test form. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<ol>\n \t<li>Record all the nameplate information of the arrester. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li>Identify each set of readings with the arrester serial number. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li>Note any special or unusual test connections or conditions. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li>Record actual test voltage, current, watts, power factor and capacitance.

        "content": "Portable appliance testing (commonly known as \"PAT\", \"PAT Inspection\" or (redundantly) as \"PAT Testing) is the term used to describe the examination of electrical appliances and equipment to ensure they are safe to use. The formal term for the process is \"in-service inspection &amp; testing of electrical equipment\". Most electrical safety defects can be found by visual examination but some types of defect can only be found by testing. However, it is essential to understand that visual examination is an essential part of the process because some types of electrical safety defect can't be detected by testing alone.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nIt's a myth that all portable electrical appliances in a low-risk environment, such as an office, need to have a portable appliance test (PAT) every year. The law simply requires employers to ensure electrical equipment is maintained in order to prevent danger – it doesn’t state what needs to be done or how often.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nThe frequency of inspection and testing depends upon the type of equipment and the environment it is used in. For example, a power tool used on a construction site should be examined more frequently than a lamp in a hotel bedroom. For guidance on suggested frequencies of inspection and testing, see: Maintaining portable and transportable electrical equipment.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>Why PAT is Done?</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\nThe key word is liability. An employer or manufacturer should show as much concern about safety as does the legal system. The liability is with the employer or owner of a place of business, or public place, to ensure that all electrical equipment accessible by employees or the public is maintained in a safe condition. The liability is with the manufacturer of electrical equipment to ensure that the equipment is safe for those who operate it. The best way to ensure electrical safety is by routine visual examination, electrical testing and documentation.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nThe NFPA standard states that “Electricity is widely recognized as a serious workplace hazard, exposing employees to electric shock, burns, fires, and explosions. Underlying causes are listed as work involving unsafe equipment and installations, workplaces made unsafe by the environment, and unsafe work performance. Hazards stemming from faulty equipment are further identified as faulty insulation, improper grounding, loose connections, defective parts, ground faults in equipment, unguarded live parts, and underrated equipment.”<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nHealth and safety regulations require that electrical appliances are safe and maintained to prevent harm to workers. Many equipment manufacturers recommend testing at regular intervals to ensure continual safety; the interval between tests depending on both the type of appliance and the environment in which it is to be used. Some equipment is just more likely to sustain damage than others. Handheld types are handled and moved more than other types and this can lead to rough handling, which often results in damage and early life failure. The legislation deems that any competent person can perform it by using a PAT instrument or tester. The visual examination of each appliance in addition to the actual PAT test should be performed only by someone who is deemed competent.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nTesting equipment has been specifically developed for PAT inspections, based on the testing equipment used by manufacturers to ensure compliance with the British Standard Code of Practice and European product standards relevant to that type of appliance. This in turn allows testing and the interpretation of results to be de-skilled to a large extent (citation needed). The inspection of the appliances can largely be carried out in-house in many organisations. This can result in cost savings and more flexibility as to exactly when a PAT is carried out.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>What is Done During PAT?</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\nA relatively brief user check (based upon simple training and perhaps assisted by the use of a brief checklist) can be a very useful part of any electrical maintenance regime. However, more formal visual inspection and testing by a competent person may also be required at appropriate intervals, depending upon the type of equipment and the environment in which it is used. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nTesting involves a visual inspection of the equipment and any flexible cables for good condition, and also where required, verification of earthing (grounding) continuity, and a test of the soundness of insulation between the current carrying parts, and any exposed metal that may be touched. The formal limits for pass/fail of these electrical tests vary somewhat depending on the category of equipment being tested.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nPAT can be done by hiring an external company, like Carelabs, to test all the electrical products in a business or it can be done in-house by a competent person. In a low-risk environment most dangerous defects can be found simply by checking the appliances for obvious signs of damage such as frayed cables.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nThe dangers of contact with live electrical parts need no explanation to an electrician.

For the purpose of legislation, portable appliances include all equipment that is not part of a fixed installation but is meant to be connected to a fixed installation or generator. Any appliance that uses a flexible cable or plug and socket qualifies as a portable appliance. In other words, if you have an appliance that has a plug that is intended to be connected to a wall socket or generator, it qualifies as needing to be PAT tested.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nThis can include items such as electric drills, monitors, printers, PCs, kettles and larger items like photocopiers, vending machines and others. So a cordless power tool would not need to be PAT tested but their battery chargers that plug into the wall for power do need to be tested.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nAll IT equipment should be tested, including power cords to this equipment although they are required to be tested separately from the equipment that they power, because they are held to a different standard. Electrical cable extensions are the most commonly tested items as they are among the most common sources of safety hazards. All of your 110 volt equipment in addition to all 3 phase equipment should also be tested.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>PAT Testing Regulations</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\nConforming to PAT testing regulations will help you to ensure that the portable appliances in your business are safe and help you to avoid violations. PAT testing legislation was put into effect to ensure that all companies conform to the Health and Safety at Work Act of 1974, Electricity at Work Regulations of 1989, Provision and Use of Work Equipment regulations of 1998 and the Management of Health and Safety at Work regulations of 1999.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nThe current law requires that all employers maintain portable appliances and ensure their safety. PAT testing law requires that all landlords, employers and even self-employed individuals make sure that their portable electrical appliances are safe and are suitable and used for the purposes intended. These appliances should always be maintained properly and remain in good working order.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nThe guidelines are designed to make certain that this equipment is kept protected and is preserved through regular maintenance as well as inspections and periodic testing. Damage and fault can occur with all electrical equipment use which makes it essential that these items are tested regularly for safety. According to PAT testing legislation, a competent person is someone who has experience or knowledge of being able to check and test appliances for safety purposes. Those with knowledge of electricity in general as well as anyone who has experience in electrical work can be deemed capable. It is imperative that employers, landlords and self-employed individuals follow the rules to ensure that their workplaces are safe. Testing can be done by any number of PAT testing companies or individuals can obtain certification to perform their own testing by successfully completing coursework in this field.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>Frequency of PAT Testing</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<strong>In order to determine how often you should have your appliances tested, you should bear in mind a few different factors: </strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Equipment that is used more should be tested more frequently.

Generally, insulation testing is carried out by applying a known test voltage (500 V DC) and measuring the resistance. On sensitive equipment (IT for example) 500 V may cause damage, and so be unsuitable. Therefore, it may be substituted with a low-voltage (250 V) insulation test, a touch current test or an alternative leakage current test. Appliances must not be touched during an insulation test because, if a fault exists, the exposed metalwork may rise to the test voltage, although this voltage in itself is not dangerous. It is performed using an ohmmeter or portable appliance tester by applying a nominal voltage to the live conductors (active and neutral) of an appliance, and placing 0 volt reference on the earthed parts of a Class I appliance or the external metal parts of a Class II appliance.\n\nThe test method varies, depending on whether the appliance is Class I or Class II. For a grounded (Class I) appliance, the insulation test is carried out between the earth pin and the combined live and neutral pins of the plug. Megger PAT testers make these connections for you. A Class II appliance is slightly different as there is no connection to the plug earth pin. This time a connection is made between the combined live and neutral pins and any metal parts or dirty/conductive areas of the casing which may involve several tests. The connection method is the same as that used for the earth bond/continuity return, using the same lead.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h3><b>Differential Leakage Test </b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\nThe differential leakage current (also called protective conductor current) test measures the difference in current between the live and neutral conductors and determines if any current is flowing to earth. Normally, appliances should have no, or very little, earth leakage current. Class II (double insulated) appliances could exhibit earth leakage through their mountings or by operator contact. During the test, the actual mains voltage is measured at the appliance socket. To ensure that the equipment is safe even when the mains supply rises to its maximum permitted value, the PAT calculates and displays the leakage current that would flow at this value.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h3><b>Leakage Current Test </b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\nIt is performed at rated voltage with values not exceeding 5mA for Class I appliances or 1mA for Class II appliances.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nAlternatively, measure insulation resistance values are not less than 1MΩ for Class I and Class II appliances at 500 V d.c. or alternatively, to avoid the equipment apparently failing the test because the metal oxide varistors (MOVs), or electro-magnetic interference (EMI) suppression has triggered, for equipment containing voltage limiting devices such as MOVs, or EMI suppression, at 250 V dc.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nLeakage current testing is performed using a PAT by applying a nominal voltage to the live conductors (active and neutral) of an appliance, and placing 0 volt reference on the earthed parts of a Class I appliance or the external metal parts of a Class II appliance.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h3><b>Load Test </b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\nThe load test (also called the operational or VA test) measures the power consumption of the equipment when running.

The label must consist of a unique identifier for the equipment, the date it was tested, the re-test date and an indication of its state. A failed asset does not need the dates on, just clear identification that it has failed. Labels may either be filled in by hand or printed.

        "content": "Polarity in electrical terms refers to the positive or negative conductors within a dc circuit, or to the Line and Neutral conductor within an ac circuit. Electrical polarity (positive and negative) is the direction of current flow in an electrical circuit. Current flows from the positive pole (terminal) to the negative pole. Electrons flow from negative to positive. In a direct current (DC) circuit, current flows in one direction only, and one pole is always negative and the other pole is always positive. In an alternating current (AC) circuit the two poles alternate between negative and positive and the direction of the current (electron flow) reverses periodically.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nMost multimeters, including digital multimeters, can do this. Regarding alternating current in the context of an ac supply, a polarity test is done to ensure that the line and neutral conductors are connected the correct way around at, for example, electrical sockets, Edison-screw lamp holders, etc.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nIn the context of electricity installations, a polarity test is used to confirm the correct connection of the line and neutral conductors. For example, for an Edison-screw lamp holder, it is important that the line conductor is connected to the centre terminal and the neutral conductor is connected to the outer conductor. Similarly, it's important to confirm that switches are located in the line conductor not the neutral conductor. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>Why </b><b>do a</b><b> Polarity Test</b><b>?</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\nThe purpose of a polarity test to ensure that all single pole devices (fuses, switches and circuit breakers) are connected in the phase conductor only. We cannot simply trust that the electricians have connected things up the right way; everyone makes mistakes, even if it’s your own work. Since ac installations consist of a Live and a Neutral conductor, it is extremely important that these conductors are connected the right way around, within all electrical accessories such as wall sockets or plugs. To ensure this, polarity test is done at each relevant point. This simple test is just as important as all the others, and many serious injuries and electrocutions could have been prevented if only polarity checks had been carried out.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\n<strong>There are 4 different scenarios that require a polarity test, these are:  </strong>\n<ol>\n \t<li>All single pole devices (fuses, switches and circuit breakers) are connected in the phase conductor only.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li>The phase conductor must be connected to the centre terminal of an Edison screw lamp holder (with the exception of E14 &amp; E27 lamp holders, these are European and occasionally crop up in the exam). <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li>All polarities of socket outlets (ring &amp; radial) must be verified. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li>The polarity of the mains supply must be correct, using an approved voltage tester.

These are described below.</strong>\n<h3><b>Method 1 </b><b>for Polarity Test</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\nThis method is exactly the same as test method one for ‘Continuity Of Protective Conductors’ if we take a lighting circuit, by putting a temporary link between phase and circuit protective conductors (cpc), at the consumers unit and our instrument at lamp holders themselves, we are creating a circuit. When we operate the light switch, the instrument changes, and then changes back to the original reading on operation of the switch again. If the reading did not change, then the switch is likely to be connected in the Neutral. (Not good!) With a little foresight this could be carried out at the same time as the continuity test. The only difference being, for radial circuits every point must be tested. The main benefit with this is it allows you to conduct 2 tests at the same time, polarity and R1 + R2. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h3><b>Method 2 for Polarity Test</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\nThis method, like wise is similar to test 2 of the continuity test, we simply use a wander lead as the return lead. There is little use for this method, within the polarity test. Method 1 is less clumsy, and is far more flexible and useful. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\n<b><i>A Note on radial socket outlets: We have covered ring final circuits, but radial final circuits involving sockets can prove to be little more involved. Why? </i></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nWell simply because doing a polarity check using method 1, will not uncover a phase to cpc reversal. If the phase and cpc were reversed at the socket, the instrument will still provide a reading. It will however tell you if you have a phase to neutral reversal (you wouldn’t have a reading at the socket). So what can we do to expose a phase? We can simply link the phase and neutral together at the board, and put our instrument across phase and neutral at the socket, if the cpc and phase have been reversed, then no reading will be recorded on the instrument. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>How is Polarity Test Done?</b> <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\nWe perform following steps for polarity testing<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h3><b>Step 1: </b><b> Polarity by Visual Inspection</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\nBy using your knowledge and sight, correct termination of cables relating to core colours can be established. It is essential that polarity is checked visually during the process of installation, especially in cases where checking by testing is impractical.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h3><b>Step </b><b>2:</b><b> Polarity by Continuity Testing</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\nIf visual inspection is not possible, you will need to use a low-resistance ohmmeter for this test.

For example, consider an installation with a no-load terminal voltage of 240 V. If, when a current of 40 A flows, the voltage falls to 238 V, the volt drop will be due to the impedance of the supply.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li>A second measurement method is to use a loop impedance tester see connected to phase and neutral (instead of phase and earth) to measure supply impedance. This can then be used with the supply voltage as above to calculate PSC. Some manufacturers modify their earth-loop testers so that this connection is made by selecting 'PSC' with a switch. The instrument measures supply voltage, and calculates, then displays, PSC.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n</ul>\nA possible difficulty in measuring PSC, and thus being able to use fuses or circuit breakers with a lower breaking capacity than that suggested by the Supply Company, is that the supply may be reinforced. More load may result in extra or different transformers and cables being installed, which may reduce supply impedance and increase PSC.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nIn terms of PFC, there is no such thing as acceptable PFC. It is what it is. When testing on 3-phase supplies the simplest and quickest way is to take the highest PFC reading off the single phase and double the value. Use Ohms Law to check. Fault current readings should be very high. Anyway its result must be lower than breaking capacity of the protective device. For example, a BS 1361 type 1 cartridge fuse has a rating of approximately 16.5KA. The result must be lower than this at the origin of installation.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>Benefits of PSC and PFC tests</b></h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>They give accurate results as its live testing. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li>The testing is simple and not much calculations are needed.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li>Increased safety for employees and third parties.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li>Reduced Insurance Premiums.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li>Asset Data management and tracking systems.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li>Minor repairs of equipment made onsite to minimise down time.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n</ul>",

The test is performed by placing a small voltage between 2 or more endpoints of the circuit. The flow of current can be verified qualitatively, by observing a light or buzzer in series with the circuit actuates or quantitatively, using a multimeter to measure the resistance between the endpoint.\n\nIn continuity testing the resistance between two points is measured. Low resistance means that the circuit is closed and there is electrical continuity. High resistance means that the circuit is open and continuity is lacking. Continuity testing can also help determine if two points are connected that should not be.\n<h2><b>Why Continuity Testing is Done?</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:300,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></h2>\nRegulation 610.1 of BS 7671:2008 IEE Wiring Regulations Seventeenth Edition requires that every installation shall, during erection and on completion before being put into service, be inspected and tested to verify that the requirements of the Regulations have been met. The purpose of this test is to verify that the CPC forms a continuous path around the circuit under test.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nA continuity test is an important test in determining the damaged components or broken conductors in a circuit.

The process that many consider to be “grounding” can and may minimize the severity of electrical faults when performed with an understanding of what happens during an electrical fault. “Grounding” is very specific; it means a connection to the earth (ground). With respect to systems, such as transformers, generators, or batteries, “grounding” generally means providing a connection from one conductor of the system to an electrode that is buried in the earth. However, not all systems are grounded nor is the electrode always in the earth. When referring to equipment, the term “grounding” can have various meanings. It may mean bonding or it may mean a direct connection to the earth. The term “bonding” sometimes may mean “grounding,” and sometimes, it may mean a short or a long connection.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>Earth Bonding</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n“Bonding” is a method by which all electrically conductive materials and metallic surfaces of equipment and structures, not normally intended to be energized, are effectively interconnected together via a low impedance conductive means and path in order to avoid any appreciable potential difference between any separate points.  <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nThe bonded interconnections of any specific electrically conductive materials, metallic surfaces of enclosures, electrical equipment, pipes, tubes, or structures via a low impedance path are completely independent and unrelated to any intended contact or connection to the Earth.  <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nThe common mean to effectively bond different metallic surfaces of enclosures, electrical equipment, pipes, tubes or structures together is with a copper conductor, rated lugs, and the appropriate bolts, fasteners, or screws.  Other effectively bonding means between different metallic parts and pieces might employ brackets, clamps, exothermic bonds, or welds to make an effectively connections.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nIn addition to preventing potential differences that may result in hazards, effectively bonded equipment can also be employed to adequately and safely conduct phase-to-ground fault current, induced currents, surge currents, lightning currents, or transient currents during such abnormal conditions.\n\n<strong>The principle purposes for an “effectively bonded grounding system via a low impedance path to earth” are intended to provide for the following.</strong><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Provide for an applicable reference to earth to stabilize the system voltage of a power distribution system during normal operations.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li>Create a very low impedance path for ground fault current to flow in a relatively controlled path.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li>Create a very low impedance path for ground fault current to flow in order for overcurrent protective devices and any ground fault protection systems to operate effectively as designed and intended.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li>Limit differences of potential, potential rise, or step gradients between equipment and personnel, personnel and earth, equipment and earth, or equipment to equipment.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li>Limit voltage rise or potential differences imposed on a power distribution system from lightning, a surge event, any phase-to-ground fault conditions, or the inadvertent commingling of or the unintentional contact with different voltage system.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></li>\n</ul>",

All metals and physical compounds have a melting point. In the course of some fire events this melting point is reached and the current carrying integrity of the wiring is compromised. The insulation may have melted internally or both the wire and insulation may have been melted. When this occurs you have a pocket of resistance that forms as the electrical current tries to flow across that melted area. As current flow increases, to try to traverse the pocket, it creates heat. That heat may create enough temperature to actually cause another fire. Just what you don’t need!  The scary part about these compromised wires is you may have no idea that this has occurred since the wire may be compromised behind the walls or in your attic <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nMegger testing does not cause any damage, making it a good option when someone does not want to put holes in walls to test electrical insulation for any problems or issues. The testing device only goes between 500 and 1,000 volts, which is relatively low. Due to the low voltage, some punctures in insulation go undetected. It generally provides information about the leakage current and whether insulation areas have excessive dirt or moisture as well as the amount of moisture, deterioration and winding faults.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>What is Done During Megger Testing?</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></h2>\nWe can test your circuits for the existing connections and melted fault areas that may have occurred during a fire event.

The device monitors the flow of electricity as it enters a property from the main distribution panel. A surge of electricity, or an imbalance of electrical power, can cause injury or death. If an imbalance in electricity is detected, the switch automatically cuts off the electricity. The installation of at least two RCD Safety Switches in a building allows the electrical circuits to be evenly divided. That increases safety two-fold by preventing electrocution, and allowing some lights and power to remain on in the building.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nResidual Current Devices are designed to protect against the risks of electrocution and fire caused by earth faults.  For example, if you cut through the cable when mowing the lawn and accidentally touched the exposed live wires or a faulty appliance overheats causing electric current to flow to earth. RCD’s are very sensitive and will activate within 10 to 30 milliseconds stopping the flow of electricity.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h3><b>Types of Residual Current Device</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\nThere are various types of RCDs that can be used to make sure you are always as safe as possible.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h3><b>Fixed RCDs</b></h3>\nThese are installed in the <a href=\"https://www.electricalsafetyfirst.org.uk/guides-and-advice/around-the-home/fuseboxes-explained/\">consumer unit (fuse box)</a> and can provide protection to individual or groups of circuits.

There is a test button on the device that has to be pressed to determine if the switch is working correctly. It is working properly if the power goes off. If the power does not go off, an electrician has to be called to re-test the switch, repair it, or replace it. It is strongly recommended that all homeowners, even those not selling the property have the devices installed for safety. The cost of installing residual current devices is nominal, especially compared to the safety of family members. In order to remain compliant to the standard, you will need to comply with the above test intervals in the section above.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nOne of the most common problems that we see in our country is that everyone is busy and it’s very easy to miss these dates and not be compliant with the standards.

(Regulation 412-06-02 refers)</li>\n</ul>\nTests are made on the load side of the RCD between the phase conductor of the protected circuit and the associated cpc. Any load or appliances should be disconnected prior to testing. RCD test instruments require a few milliamperes to operate; this is normally obtained from the phase and neutral of the circuit under test. When testing a three-phase RCD protecting a three-wire circuit, the instrument’s neutral is required to be connected to earth. This means that the test current will be increased by the instrument supply current and will cause some devices to operate during the 50% test, possibly indicating an incorrect operating time. Under this circumstance it is necessary to check the operating parameters of the RCD with the manufacturer before failing the RCD.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nThe RCD Testing Requirements indicate that a manager is required to test each device every three months. To conduct these tests, they must present the test button found on the residual current device. The RCD Testing results determine if the device is worked correctly. After each test, the manager must reset the device by pressing the appropriate button.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nIf at any time the test indicates that it isn’t operating properly, the manager must order a new device and shut down power to the location. They must tag and lock the device in the location in which it is used.

Other tests confirm the device(s) are not oversensitive that would leave you without power unnecessarily. If you are not sure when the rcds within your installation have been tested, get in touch to make an appointment for me to test them for you. When RCD tests are carried out, it will trip the RCD and disconnect the circuit that it protects, so any electrical equipment will need to be turned off prior to RCD Testing being carried out.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nEach RCD Test only takes approximately 5 minutes for each RCD.

        "content": "A Short circuit analysis is used to determine the magnitude of short circuit current, the system is capable of producing, and compares that magnitude with the interrupting rating of the overcurrent protective devices (OCPD). Since the interrupting ratings are based by the standards, the methods used in conducting a short circuit analysis must conform to the procedures which the standard making organizations specify for this purpose. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) publishes both the standards for equipment and the application guides, which describes the calculation methods.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nShort-Circuit Currents are currents that introduce large amounts of destructive energy in the forms of heat and magnetic force into a power system. A short circuit is sometimes called a fault. It is a specific kind of current that introduces a large amount of energy into a power system. It can be in the form of heat or in the form of magnetic force. Basically, it is a low-resistance path of energy that skips part of a circuit and causes the bypassed part of the circuit to stop working. The reliability and safety of electric power distribution systems depend on accurate and thorough knowledge of short-circuit fault currents that can be present, and on the ability of protective devices to satisfactorily interrupt these currents. Knowledge of the computational methods of power system analysis is essential to engineers responsible for planning, design, operation, and troubleshooting of distribution systems.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nShort circuit currents impose the most serious general hazard to power distribution system components and are the prime concerns in developing and applying protection systems. Fortunately, short circuit currents are relatively easy to calculate. The application of three or four fundamental concepts of circuit analysis will derive the basic nature of short circuit currents. These concepts will be stated and utilized in a step-by step development.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nThe three phase bolted short circuit currents are the basic reference quantities in a system study. In all cases, knowledge of the three phase bolted fault value is wanted and needs to be singled out for independent treatment. This will set the pattern to be used in other cases.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nA device that interrupts short circuit current, is a device connected into an electric circuit to provide protection against excessive damage when a short circuit occurs. It provides this protection by automatically interrupting the large value of current flow, so the device should be rated to interrupt and stop the flow of fault current without damage to the overcurrent protection device. The OCPD will also provide automatic interruption of overload currents.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nShort-circuit calculations are required for the application and coordination of protective relays and the rating of equipment. All fault types can be simulated. Carelab’s short-circuit study provides a detailed report identifying breaker ratings, breaker fault duties, discussions, and recommendations for any deficiencies found<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:195,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>Risks Associated With Short Circuit Currents</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></h2>\nThe building/facility may not be properly protected against short-circuit currents. These currents can damage or deteriorate equipment. Improperly protected short-circuit currents can injure or kill maintenance personnel. Recently, new initiatives have been taken to require facilities to properly identify these dangerous points within the power distribution of the facility.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>Why Is A Short Circuit Dangerous?</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:225,&quot;335559739&quot;:150,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></h2>\nA short circuit current can be very large. If unusually high currents exceed the capability of protective devices (fuses, circuit breakers, etc.) it can result in large, rapid releases of energy in the form of heat, intense magnetic fields, and even potentially as explosions known as an arc blast. The heat can damage or destroy wiring insulation and electrical components. An arc blast produces a shock wave that may carry vaporized or molten metal, and can be fatal to unprotected people who are close by.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nFault current calculations are necessary to properly select the type, interrupting rating, and tripping characteristics of power and lighting system circuit breakers and fuses. Results of the fault current calculations are also used to determine the required short-circuit ratings of power distribution system components including bus transfer switches, variable speed drives, switchboards, load centres, and panel boards. In calculating the maximum fault current, it is necessary to determine the total contribution from all generators that may be paralleled and the motor contribution from induction and synchronous motors.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nShort Circuit Analysis is performed to determine the currents that flow in a power system under fault conditions. If the short circuit capacity of the system exceeds the capacity of the protective device, a dangerous situation exists. Since growth of a power system often results in increased available short-circuit current, the momentary and interrupting rating of new and existing equipment on the system must be checked to ensure the equipment can withstand the short-circuit energy (see Device Evaluation). Fault contributions for utility sources, motors and generators are taken into consideration. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nA Short Circuit Analysis will help to ensure that personnel and equipment are protected by establishing proper interrupting ratings of protective devices (circuit breaker and fuses). If an electrical fault exceeds the interrupting rating of the protective device, the consequences can be devastating.  It can be a serious threat to human life and is capable of causing injury, extensive equipment damage, and costly downtime.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nOn large systems, short circuit analysis is required to determine both the switchgear ratings and the relay settings.  No substation equipment can be installed with knowledge of the complete short circuit values for the entire power distribution system.  The short circuit calculations must be maintained and periodically updated to protect the equipment and CC the lives. It is not safe to assume that new equipment is properly rated.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nThe results of a Short Circuit Analysis are also used to selectively coordinate electrical protective devices.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>What is Short Circuit Analysis?</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></h2>\nShort circuit analysis essentially consists of determining the steady state solution of a linear network with balanced three phase excitation. Such an analysis provides currents and voltages in a power system during the faulted condition. This information is needed to determine the required interrupting capacity of the circuit breakers and to design proper relaying system. To get enough information, different types of faults are simulated at different locations and the study is repeated.

Since the connectors are solidly bolted there in no arc created and the high current quickly trips a protective device limiting the damage.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nAn arc fault is one in which the short circuit creates an arc. An arc is a flow of electricity between two conductors that are not in contact. The resulting intense heat can result in a fire, significant damage to the equipment, and possibly an arc flash or arc blast resulting in serious injuries.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nA ground fault is when electricity finds an unintended, low resistance, path to ground. When that path goes through a human body the resulting heat can cause serious burns, and the electrical shock can disrupt the functioning of the human heart (fibrillation).<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>What Are Symmetrical and Asymmetrical Currents?</b></h2>\nA polyphase system may experience either a symmetrical or an asymmetrical fault. A symmetrical fault current is one that affects all phases equally. If just some of the phases are affected, or the phases are affected unequally, then the fault current is asymmetrical.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:225,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nSymmetrical faults are relatively simple to analyse, however they account for very few actual faults. Only about 5% of faults are symmetrical.

Under this condition, impedance representation for the transmission network with ground as reference does not exist. However, connection to the ground is established at the generator buses, representing the generator as a constant voltage source behind appropriate reactant. Hence let us consider the combined transmission-generator network and while tearing the network, let us ensure that each sub-network has atleast one generator. In practice this should pose no difficulty since large power system 84 networks normally consist of different areas having generations in each area. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n<h2><b>Neplan</b></h2>\nShort circuit analysis is performed so that existing and new equipment ratings were sufficient to with stand the available short circuit current.

This effect is often described by the term Electrical Contact Resistance or ECR and may vary with time, most often decreasing, in a process known as resistance creep. The idea of potential drop on the injection electrode was introduced by William Shockley to explain the difference between the experimental results and the model of gradual channel approximation. In addition to the term ECR, \"Interface resistance\", \"transitional resistance\", or just simply \"correction term\" are also used.

This involves injecting a fixed current, usually around 100A, 200A and 300 A through the contacts and measuring the voltage drop across it.  This test is done with a special contact resistance measuring instrument. Then, using Ohm's law, the resistance value is calculated. The resistance value needs to be compared with the value given by the manufacturer.

These will differ by equipment and manufacturer and there is no code or standard that mandates minimum contact resistances. As such, manufacturer recommendations need to be consulted. For example, manufacturers sometimes quote a maximum contact resistance of 10 micro-ohms for large bolted busbar joints.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:120,&quot;335559739&quot;:120,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nContact resistance measurement and its application domain are fairly extensive. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h3><b>Electrical Connections</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\nThe electric connections of circuits have various ways and means, such as connected by welding, by pressing, by plug in and blot tightly and so on. If you want to know the quality of a connector and its conduction characteristic, you just need to measure its contact resistance. The contact resistance was often applied in quality testing of switches, relays and PCB pads. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nAt the aspect of the machinery assembly, the contact resistance of metals contact surface can be used in estimating the reliability and tightness of the machinery assembly. The contact resistance is associated with the conduction characteristic of contact surface. The larger area and the less impurity of the pair metals surface is, the better conductivity and the lower resistance are, and vice versa. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\nBy the ways of measuring contact resistance we can qualitatively analyse the reliability and tightness of the machinery assembly. This technique has been already applied in quality test of the shield assembly for EMC. Measurement methods for different application are not the same. For example, in the case of measuring contact resistance of high-power switches and relays, high current should be used, a pair of contact, things just like the condition what is actually happening in working status. In the case of a dry circuit connector, the test current should be low to prevent the joint to be melted by heat, (the current less than 100mA). <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h3><b>Machinery Assembly</b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\nIn the case of testing the machinery assembly quality, the different test circuits should be selected according to the different structures.

This method is very useful for measuring contact resistance in complicated machinery assembles. The contact resistance is defined as the ratio the voltage across the contact to the current flown through a closed pair of contacts. It accorded with Ohm’s law. There is an interface between the metal 1 and metal 2. The current, I, which coming from the current source flows through this interface, can be read from a current meter. And then the voltage drop across the interface can be read from a voltage meter as, U. Then the contact resistance value, Rx, can be calculated by.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\n<em><strong>Rx=U/I </strong></em>\n\nBecause the contact resistance changes with environment and the current pass through, the condition for measurement should be close as the condition in use. The four-terminal measurement technique and eliminating thermally EMFs technique must be used in accurate measurement. This indirect measurement method can be applied in measuring contact resistance or loop resistance. It needs three test points, three steps and three formulas. This method had been approved correct, and can also be used in calibrating the loop- resistor standard.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h2 aria-level=\"2\"><b>Typical Method for Contact Resistance Test</b></h2>\nThe four-wire (Kelvin) DC voltage drop is the typical method used by micro-ohmmeters for the contact resistance test, which ensures more accurate measurements by eliminating the own contact resistance and resistance of test leads. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:300,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n<ul>\n \t<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"9\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\">The contact resistance test is performed using two current connections for the injection, and two potential leads for the voltage drop measurement; the voltage cables must be connected as closer as possible to the connection to be tested, and always inside the circuit formed by the connected current leads.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:300,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"9\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\">From the measurement of the voltage drop, the microprocessor controlled micro-ohmmeters calculate the contact resistance, while eliminates the possible errors due to thermal EMF effects in the connections (thermal EMFs are small thermocouple voltages which are generated when two different metals are joined together) they will be added to the total voltage drop measured, and will introduce errors into the contact resistance test if they are not subtracted from the measurement through different methods (reversal of polarity and averaging, directly measuring of thermal EMFs magnitude, etc.)<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:300,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"9\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"3\" data-aria-level=\"1\">If low resistance readings are obtained when testing the breaker contact resistance using a low current, then it is recommended to re-test the contacts at a higher current.

        "content": "The Factory Acceptance Test (FAT) is a process that evaluates the equipment during and after the assembly process by verifying that it is built and operating in accordance with design specifications. FAT ensures that the components and controls are working properly according to the functionality of the equipment itself. As the name suggests, this testing is performed at the factory.\nFAT is typically conducted in order to assess any discrepancies and non-conformities, as well as develop a process for how they are to be handled. Deviations or abnormalities observed during testing are documented in a problem report and corrected prior to shipment.\nThe FAT is a customized testing procedure for different types of systems and the tests are executed before the final installation at the plant. The FAT is not a requirement but recommended to be carried out, according to the standard IEC 61511, if the application software of the logic solver is fairly complex or if the architecture of the safety instrumented system is using redundant arrangements.\nFAT must be conducted in a thorough and forthright manner. A poor or rushed FAT can lead to missed non conformities, which can only then be corrected after the equipment is installed—which in turn can wreak havoc on a project schedule.\n<h2>Why is Factory Acceptance Testing Required?</h2>\nFATs are beneficial not just for the buyer and end users but for the manufacturer as well.  Both parties can be assured that the equipment meets all the contractual specifications and any issues can be addressed before arriving at the customer’s site.  Rectifying issues while the system is still in the possession of the manufacturer helps to keep the project on track and within budget.    FATs almost always save time and money over fixing issues in the field.\nOur broad factory acceptance test is the most lucrative way to ensure that your equipment or plant operates correctly. As a highly qualified, independent third-party, we have the trusted skills and resources to perform steadfast testing. Alternatively, we can witness appropriate testing on your behalf. In many cases it is difficult to predict the correct operation of the safety instrumented system or consequences due to failures in some parts of the safety instrumented system. For that reason the FAT is a valuable check of the safety issues.\nThe safety of your employees is always a top concern so the quality assurance gives you the peace of mind that all components of your system are functioning the way they should, and within the full range of operating specifications.\n<h3>Factory Acceptance Test Helps You to:</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Achieve independent proof of functionality, quality and integrity with our comprehensive checking process</li>\n \t<li>Verify all important documents, such as manuals, instructions, plans, drawings, piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&amp;IDs)</li>\n \t<li>Ensure that your equipment or plant performs as expected under the testable range of likely conditions, including mishandling and error</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What are the Process in Factory Acceptance Testing?</h2>\nThe main objective of the FAT is to test the safety instrumented system (logic solver and associated software together). The tests are normally executed during the final part of the design and engineering phase before the final installation at the plant. The FAT is a customized procedure of checking the safety instrumented system and the safety instrumented functions according to the safety requirements specification.\n\nThe FAT includes appropriate general testing procedures for verification of the correct operation of the safety instrumented system. Since the testing activities are general methods the FAT is applicable to programmable or non-programmable safety instrumented systems. The most important part of the FAT addresses specification of the test cases i.e. clear description of the test cases, well-structured test procedures and relevant test cases.\n\nIt’s important to note here that there are varying levels of an FAT.  They can be performed at a very basic level, such as setting up the main pieces of the system with temporary wiring and making sure everything moves as it is supposed to, or a more complete FAT can be conducted where the manufacturer physically builds the whole system in their shop to test it fully.  In the latter example, the system is then taken apart, moved to the customer’s site, and put back together again.\n\nThe FAT is normally performed at the manufacturer work shop. The manufacturer checks that the safety instrumented system works as intended and according to the requirements stated in the safety system works as intended and according to the requirements the safety requirements specification, NRN. During the FAT the manufacturer checks:\n<ul>\n \t<li>The used equipment are mending to the specification eg, compatible HW and SW versions</li>\n \t<li>The used equipment are installed according to manufacturer's specification</li>\n \t<li>The input and the outputs are connected according to the drawings</li>\n \t<li>The calibration of the equipment are correct</li>\n \t<li>The trip points operate according to the requirements in the SRS.</li>\n \t<li>The associated software operate according to the requirements in the SRS the outputs and their actions behave according to the SRS</li>\n \t<li>The reset functions operate according to the SRS</li>\n \t<li>The alarms operate according to the SRS</li>\n \t<li>The operator functions operate according to the SRS</li>\n \t<li>The bypass functions operate according to the SRS</li>\n \t<li>The manual shutdown functions operate according to the SRS</li>\n \t<li>The diagnostic alarm functions operate according to the SRS</li>\n</ul>\nThe outputs from the safety instrumented function are examined during different test cases e.g. simulation of inputs in order to verity that the safety instrumented functions meet the requirements in the safety requirements specification.\nThe FAT reveals weaknesses in the design and engineering phase or in the safety requirement specification phase these phases have to be modified according to the result of the FAT. In order to check the modifications the safety instrumented system has to be re- tested.\n<h3>Following are the points to remember while conducting FAT</h3>\n<strong>Provide a detailed test plan. </strong>\nThe FAT is the time to discover failures or issues, determine reliability, verify efficiencies, and explore how the machine should handle failures. The test plan should be prepared up front and submitted to the supplier as part of the Request for Quote (RFQ). The machine will not perform as expected if the criteria aren’t specified; neither will performance be competently assessed. Clearly state in the contract all the responsibilities, accountabilities, and deliverables, in a measurable way. These must be quantifiable and agreed upon to eliminate finger-pointing. Doing so makes it easier for all parties by eliminating second-guessing. Specify how long the machine should be dry-cycled; 24 hours minimum is recommended. Specify how many packages should be produced and at what speed. Specify disposal plans for finished packages. Although you’ll pay for the FAT, most equipment suppliers will agree to a provision that if the machine fails, any subsequent test is free. Having a detailed test plan will help ensure that you don’t short-change the FAT. Performing a brief, shallow FAT will inevitably show up as a problem in the third shift, nine months down the road.\n\n<strong>Push the envelope, but use the right materials as well. </strong>\nIn the FAT, use the materials that will be put in operation during actual production. Not using them may compromise test validity. You can stretch the system with noncompliant materials and processes to better understand operational flexibility (wildcard testing), but the most important results will be those gleaned from using the materials you actually employ in your process.\n\n<strong>Engage the operators and technicians.</strong>\nFocus on the personnel who will ultimately be responsible for running the machines, those who “own the line.” Sending engineers isn’t sufficient; the operators will see what makes the most sense on the line. The people who will run the equipment daily are uniquely qualified to make observations beyond the specifications and recognize issues or flaws prior to delivery. Additionally, the ownership aspect is invaluable, as the best technology going into a plant is not going to work if the operators are not comfortable with it, or have no faith in it. Engaging the production team early in the process is one of the most important aspects of new equipment design.\nBe smart about training.\nIf training is provided as part of the FAT, make sure the people being trained are those who will run the line, not the engineers. Train and educate the right people.\n\n<strong>Create and follow a detailed “failure script.” </strong>\nMake an inventory of the type of failures that you’ve experienced or might experience in production, as well as expected outcomes. Use this checklist to fully assess machine performance during the FAT. Machines have a natural backup curve that is all about early failures. Running, even dry running, is very critical; you can find leakage, electronic failures, and more, and then make sensible engineering changes. You can’t reap the benefits of testing if you don’t do the testing. Changes made at the FAT stage are the least-expensive ones; many times you don’t even pay for them.\n\n<strong>Test parts replacement and changeover procedures. </strong>\nTest how long it takes to replace the most common wear parts. Determine how to remove a defective part and document the process in an easy-to-use format such as a One Point Lesson (OPL). Using your technicians and operators at the FAT, practice changeovers, and start-up and shut-down protocols. See where the users encounter difficulty and elicit their input and ideas. Leverage the opportunity to modify the equipment, standardize the procedures, and document in an OPL format with numerous pictures.\n\n<strong>Check safety with a keen eye. </strong>\nComplete a review of the equipment from a safety perspective. Look for poorly guarded areas and pinch points. Run your hands across the machine (carefully), looking for sharp edges and burrs. Test to ensure all limit switches and emergency stops are fully functional, robust, and appropriately placed. Test for flaws in all built in safety components. Are there any safety options missing? Is making the machine LOTO (Lockout/Tagout) easy, or are there unexpected sources of energy that could cause injury? (Lockout/Tagout refers to the act of disabling all sources of energy such as electricity and compressed air while physically locking down the machine so that it doesn’t cause injury due to movement while the machine is being worked on.)\n\n<strong>Take your time. </strong>\nTake your time on the FAT, especially with highly customized machines. Why would you take a million-dollar project and squeeze the FAT into a six-hour window? Don’t worry about relatively small expenses. Some testing will be more challenging than others. For example, high-speed testing can be difficult due to the sheer volume of product needed for the test. Never trade away adequate factory testing to meet a shipping deadline. You will ultimately pay the price for this in longer start-ups and lost productivity at the factory.\n\n<strong>Get a good integrator. </strong>\nThis is key. Tie into other equipment suppliers; test everything together. Sometimes it’s worth the money to run everything together on the integrator’s floor. It costs money, but saves it in the long run. Get as much of the peripheral equipment together on the same floor at the same time as soon as you can. Test as much as you can. You can never over-test equipment reliability and range of operation.\n\n<strong>Work with your supplier, and your supplier will work with you. </strong>\nA successful FAT is in both parties’ interest. Not all (or many) machinery suppliers have factories set up to perform a well-rounded FAT for customers. Some will build or mock up complete systems, but duplicating a customer’s process can be very difficult and expensive. Suppliers may be able to prove to the end user that their machine can perform in the manner desired during pre-sales (or pre-PO) product-testing procedures. Once customers are satisfied that equipment can do what they want it to do, POs are issued. Increasingly, customers are simply looking for a video testimonial that the machine actually runs before it leaves the supplier’s facility, in lieu of a FAT. That being said, savvy customers will continue to demand FATs and training in a supplier’s facility before the machine ships. Some suppliers are expanding their facilities to include more FAT handling, in a private, secure environment, where strict confidentiality of all technologies is assured.\n\n<strong>Know the difference between a Factory and Site Acceptance Test. </strong>\nOne of the biggest areas of confusion surrounding the FAT is over whether it should simulate how the machine responds under actual factory conditions. In fact, that is the purpose of the Site Acceptance Test (SAT). In the machinery builder’s plant, it may be difficult or even impossible to simulate both the production volume and the conditions of your product, especially for more than a few minutes. This is especially true if the product will be packed at a certain temperature, or has a certain consistency or rate of speed coming out of production. Much time, energy, and money has been spent in vain trying to address “failures” in the machine builder’s plant, only to find that the machine works perfectly once in production at the customer’s plant.\nThe purpose of the FAT is to verify the desired functionality of the machine. On acceptance of a FAT, you’ll be looking for items such as:\n\n<strong>Completed FAT protocol.</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Maintenance and users’ manuals</li>\n \t<li>Easy-to-use training materials (OPLs, videos, etc.)</li>\n \t<li>Standard work procedures</li>\n \t<li>Standard maintenance procedures</li>\n \t<li>Recommended spare parts lists</li>\n \t<li>Certificates of compliance</li>\n \t<li>As-built technical drawings (electrical, mechanical, pneumatic, and process schemes)</li>\n \t<li>Materials certificates and data sheets</li>\n \t<li>Main equipment data sheets</li>\n \t<li>Instruments calibration certificates</li>\n \t<li>Welding processes qualifications</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How to get an Effective Result from Factory Acceptance Testing?</h2>\nPreparation is key to getting the most out of a FAT. Here are a few of the tips you can use to set your stretch wrapper FAT up to deliver the greatest benefit.\n<ol>\n \t<li>Use the right materials. In the FAT, use the materials that will be put in operation during actual production. Not using them may compromise test validity. With stretch wrappers, specifically, providing the film that will be used in production is also a key component as the gauge &amp; quality of the film has a significant impact on how the machine is set up and its overall performance.</li>\n \t<li>Engage the operators and technicians. Focus on the personnel who will ultimately be responsible for running the machines, those who “own the line.” Sending engineers isn’t sufficient; the operators will see what makes the most sense on the line.</li>\n \t<li>Be smart about training. If training is provided as part of the FAT, make sure the people being trained are those who will run the line, not the engineers. Train and educate the right people.</li>\n \t<li>Create and follow a detailed “failure script.” Make an inventory of the type of failures you might experience in production, as well as expected outcomes. Use this checklist to fully assess machine performance during the FAT.</li>\n \t<li>Check safety with a keen eye. Complete a review of the equipment from a safety perspective. Look for poorly guarded areas and pinch points.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How to Conduct Factory Acceptance Testing?</h2>\nThere are several components that make up FAT. The product must be assembled, prepared, and connected to utilities for testing. Documentation such as drawings, ASME certificates, and test procedures must be gathered. And finally, testing must be conducted in the factory that follows specific test procedures.\nBefore the FAT begins, the manufacturer should present the FAT procedure to the client for review and approval. The procedure should include testing of as much functionality as is practical in the factory and, where possible, should show pass/fail criteria or desired results for each item tested. Once the procedure is approved, the manufacturer should test the equipment before the FAT begins. Keep in mind that some clients like to visit the factory during FAT, so this “pre-test” will confirm that the sterilizer is set up with the correct options, ensure a smoother FAT process and minimize down-time during the FAT.\n<h3>Step 1: Process done before FAT (Pre-FAT):</h3>\nA pre-planning is necessary for an efficient FAT. The planning presents a set op of the appropriate tests to be carried out and who is responsible for developing the test cases. Appropriate levels of competence and independence of assessors are required. The realization of tests shall be described as well as the personnel responsible to carry out the test. The test protocol is developed during the planning and furthermore who is responsible to attest the test protocol.\nThe procedures to carry out the FAT shall be well defined and documented in a proper way. Each test procedure shall be described in a logical sequence i.e. How to test the application software and hardware. The needed competence for involved test personnel is described during the planning. It is recommended that personnel with experience suitable for the intended process application and safety instrumented system deals with the FAT planning.\n<ul>\n \t<li>The testing included in a FAT procedure should be largely derived from the performance criteria defined in the Functional Requirements Document (FRD), which is created by the project team early in the project planning process.  The FRD should be the focal point for discussions when interviewing potential system integrators and should be included in the contract/purchase order package.  These requirements should, therefore, be well known and understood well before time to develop the actual FAT protocol.</li>\n \t<li>The system integrator/dealer should prepare and submit a FAT procedure well in advance of the FAT. This procedure should be reviewed and approved by the system owner/project manager. It should attempt to include testing of as much functionality as is practical in the factory, and check of all interfaces among equipment and systems. Where possible the procedure should show pass/fail criteria or desired results for each item.</li>\n \t<li>The dealer should also provide a schedule for the FAT showing all timing and sequence of testing.</li>\n \t<li>Prior to FAT all design approvals should be complete. This is to remove technical ambiguity from the FAT and prevent disputes over work that continues after FAT.</li>\n \t<li>The dealer should prepare a test facility that can be effectively used to conduct the FAT testing, including calibrated test equipment and any special test equipment.</li>\n \t<li>The dealer should compile a document set that can support the testing and serve as a reference for the test results, including:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Contract specifications and copies of all references called out in the specification.</li>\n \t<li>All drawings for the project, including drawings received from other vendors that describe interfaces.</li>\n \t<li>Detailed testing check list, including pass/fail criteria.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n \t<li>The dealer is to pretest the system before FAT.  Failure to do this can result in wasted time during FAT, and potentially a prolonged extension of FAT while fixes are effected.</li>\n \t<li>If the system in question is large enough to impact the system owner’s facilities, laboratory layout or utilities or if there are any questions regarding moving the system into the owner’s facility, it is highly recommended that a person responsible for the owner’s physical plant/facility be invited to attend FAT.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Step 2: Process done during FAT</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Review the specification line by line while checking the equipment or drawings for compliance with the specification, including any change orders.</li>\n \t<li>Inspect for workmanship\nInspect for problems that can occur during installation or use of the equipment, for example, lifting points and safe access to components for maintenance, etc.</li>\n \t<li>Test of the equipment per the dealer’s approved procedure; these should include functionality testing and regulatory testing. Ad hoc testing may be required to define any major non-conformities revealed by testing.</li>\n \t<li>Note the software and firmware versions in the equipment being tested.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Factory Acceptance Test Result</h2>\nAll the test cases of the FAT shall be explained in the documentation and furthermore if the objectives and criteria of the tests have been met or not. Exposed failures during the test are documented and the causes for the failures are also documented supported by essential actions to correct the failures. If there are modifications of the safety instrumented system it is necessary to carry out a safety analysis in order to determine if the safety is affected and if re-testing is necessary.\n<h3>Step 3: Processes done after Factory Acceptance Testing</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Check of documentation</li>\n \t<li>Confirm vendor’s/dealer’s schedule for completing all documentation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Benefits of  Factory Acceptance Testing</h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Customers can “touch and feel” the equipment while it is in operational mode before it ships.</li>\n \t<li>The manufacturer can provide some initial hands on training to the customer, giving operating personnel more confidence when running the machinery for the first time in real-world settings.</li>\n \t<li>Key project people from both sides are together, making it an ideal time to review the bill of materials, discuss required and recommended spare parts (for start-up and first year of operation) and review maintenance procedures and equipment limitations.</li>\n \t<li>The thorough FAT documentation can be used as a template for the Installation Qualification portion of the validated process/installation.</li>\n \t<li>Based on the results of the FAT, both parties can create a punch list of additional items that need to be addressed prior to shipment.</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;",

        "content": "Equipment applied to electric power systems to detect abnormal and intolerable conditions and to initiate appropriate corrective actions. These devices include lightning arresters, surge protectors, fuses, and relays with associated circuit breakers, reclosers, and so forth.\n\nFrom time to time, disturbances in the normal operation of a power system occur. These may be caused by natural phenomena, such as lightning, wind, or snow; by falling objects such as trees; by animal contacts or chewing; by accidental means traceable to reckless drivers, inadvertent acts by plant maintenance personnel, or other acts of humans; or by conditions produced in the system itself, such as switching surges, load swings, or equipment failures. Protective devices must therefore be installed on power systems to ensure continuity of electrical service, to limit injury to people, and to limit damage to equipment when problem situations develop. Protective devices are applied commensurately with the degree of protection desired or felt necessary for the particular system.\n<h2>Why Protective Device Testing is Done?</h2>\nProtection systems play a key role for the safe and reliable operation of today’s electricity power systems. Properly working protection devices help to maintain the safety of the system and to safeguard assets from damage. In order to ensure reliable operation, protective relays as well as recloser controls must be tested throughout their life-cycle, from their initial development through production and commissioning to periodical maintenance during operation. Our test equipment is ideal for each of these life-cycle phases and for any environment. As a reliable long-term partner, we offer state-of-the-art testing solutions which are continuously being developed and maintained to help you to keep pace with the increasingly complex requirements of your systems.\n<h2>What is Done During Protective Device Testing?</h2>\nLightning protection is a means to protect equipment, facilities and people from the effects of nearby or direct lightning events. Whereas, surge protection provides protection to equipment from the effects of more distant lightning events or power system anomalies. Five basic procedures are employed to <a href=\"https://carelabs.me/protective-devices-testing-services/\">test protection devices</a>.\n\n<strong>Clamping Voltage Tests</strong>\n\nWhen a transient occurs, the <strong>SPD</strong> resistance changes from a very high stand-by value to a very low conduction value. The transient is absorbed and clamped at a defined level, protecting sensitive electronic circuits and diverting the transient energy to ground. A normalised current impulse of 8/20us is defined in the standards <strong>IEC 61643-1</strong> and <strong>IEC61180-1</strong>.\n\n<strong>Surge Withstand Tests\n</strong>Surge withstand tests are intended to assess the maximum peak current carrying capability of varistors. The surge withstand capability is approximately proportional to the varistor disk size (diameter). Energy levels are much higher than for the clamping voltage tests with impulse levels in the tens of kilo amps range.\n\n<strong>Energy Absorption Tests\n</strong>High energy surges are usually generated by inductive discharges of motors and transformers. Energy absorption in an SPD is the integral current flow through and the voltage across an SPD. Surge currents of relatively long duration are required for testing maximum energy absorption capacity of an SPD. A rectangular wave of 2ms duration is sometimes used instead of the double exponential waveforms.\n\n<strong>Combination Wave Tests\n</strong>Surge events can be generated by lightning phenomena, switching transients or the activation of protection devices in the power distribution system. A surge itself is influenced by the propagation path taken so that impulses from the same event may have different forms depending upon where a measurement is taken. Combination Wave Generators (<strong>CWG</strong>) simulate a surge event in power lines close to or within building.\n\n<strong>Duty Cycle (Flammability) Tests\n</strong>A series of pulses is applied to the varistor to assess maximum rated dissipation. Exceeding the maximum rated dissipation will cause the protection device to be destroyed. A flammability risk could occur. The 8/20us current impulse is superimposed on the mains power supply\n<h2>How do We Conduct Protective Device Testing?</h2>\nBasic devices have the ability to recognize and define fuses, protective relays, breaker trip devices, and surge suppressors and to understand their differences and uses. A common mistake for relay testers is to use spare outputs, displays, and/or LEDs for their pickup and timing tests and ignore the in-service output logic, believing that they are using the same elements in their test equations as the final logic.\n<h3><strong>Depending on the protective device the tests varies accordingly:</strong></h3>\n<strong>Low-voltage breakers\n</strong>They conduct the flow of current as long as a nominal value of current is flowing through the circuit to the load attached to it. Even at the slightest contact, current conduction occurs. But as soon as the breaker senses an excessively large amount which does not lie in its operating range (which can be checked through the ratings of the circuit breaker), the trip unit actuates the bimetallic strip and the contact breaks and immediately further flow of current is stopped. In addition to the safety operation, it also provides a kind of voltage insulation to the circuit and retains the flow after the current retains its appropriate value.\n\nThe field-testing and calibration of solid-state trip units can be performed by either primary current injection method or secondary current injection method. A coordination study is an organized effort to achieve optimum electrical distribution system protection by determining the appropriate frame sizes, ampere ratings and settings of overcurrent protective devices. When an overcurrent occurs in a properly coordinated distribution system, only the protective device nearest the fault will open. The <a href=\"https://carelabs.me/secondary-current-injection-test/\">secondary injection test</a> is performed using a specially designed power supply unit. It should be noted that the secondary injection method only tests the solid-state trip unit logic and does not test the current sensors, wiring, or the breaker current handling components. Most solid-state trip units have terminal blocks that are equipped with test plug terminals for making the calibration test. The test set allows checking of the solid state trip unit operation without using primary current. The test set will pass enough current to check any desired calibration point. The breaker must be de-energized before checking the operation of the solid-state trip units. If the test set shows that the solid-state trip unit is not functioning properly, the trip unit should be replaced.\n\nThe primary current injection method is usually preferred because this method verifies the sensors and wiring, as well as the conduction path in the breaker. It is recommended that the primary injection test be performed simultaneously on all three phases when testing breakers with solid-state trip units. If three phase primary injection testing is not practical, then it is recommended that the sensors and wiring should be tested separately. This testing should be performed per <strong>NETA</strong> and the <strong>National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA)</strong> procedures, and in accordance with manufacturer recommendations. Coordination Time-current curves are used to show the amount of time required for a circuit breaker to trip at a given overcurrent level.\n\n<strong>Relays\n</strong>A relay is an automatic device which senses an abnormal condition of electrical circuit and closes its contacts.\n\nThe first electrical test made on the relay should be a pickup test. Pickup is defined as that value of current or voltage which will just close the relay contacts from the 0.5 time-dial position. Allowing for meter differences, interpretation of readings, etc., this value should be within ±5% of previous data. Generally, one or two points on the time-current curve are sufficient for maintenance purposes. Reset the relay to the original time-dial setting and two points that could be checked and 3 and 5 times pickup. Of course, other points could be used, but the important thing is to always use the same point(s). The instantaneous unit should be checked for pickup using gradually applied current for reasons previously discussed. Wherever possible, current should be applied only to the instantaneous unit (to avoid over-heating the time unit).\n\n<strong>There are different types of relays:</strong>\n\n<strong>Current Relays\n</strong>Relays can include phase overcurrent, current balance, negative sequence, zero sequence, thermal, and ground fault.\n\nThis is the first generation oldest relaying system and they have been in use for many years. They have earned a well-deserved reputation for accuracy, dependability, and reliability.\n\n<strong>Contact function</strong> - Manually close (or open) contacts and observe that they perform their required function, i.e. trip, reclose, block, etc.\n\n<strong>Pickup</strong> - Gradually apply current or voltage to see that pickup is within limits. Since preventive maintenance is the guide post, gradually applied current or voltage will yield data which can be compared with previous or future data and not be clouded by such effects as transient overreach, etc.\n\n<strong>Dropout or reset</strong> - Reduce the current until the relay drops out or fully resets. This test will indicate excess friction. Should the relay be sluggish in resetting or fail to reset completely, then the jewel bearing and pivot should be examined. A 4X eye loupe is adequate for examining the pivot, and the jewel bearing can be examined with the aid of a needle which will reveal any cracks in the jewel. Should dirt be the problem, the jewel can be cleaned with an orange stick while the pivot can be wiped clean with a soft, lint free cloth. No lubricant should be used on either the jewel or pivot.\n\nTest should be made to check that the overcurrent unit operates only when the directional unit contacts are closed.\n\n<strong>Directional and Power Relays\n</strong>Directional overcurrent relaying refers to relaying that can use the phase relationship of voltage and current to determine direction to a fault.\n\nPower Directional Relays provides protection against excess power flow in a predetermined direction. And are used for anti-motoring protect on of AC generators.\n\nThe simplest pickup test for a directional unit is an in-phase test - i.e. current and voltage in phase. This test will eliminate the need for a three-phase supply, phase shifter, and phase-angle meter. However, it must be kept in mind that such a test is usually far from the angle of maximum torque (usually 60° lag for ground relays) and thus, small changes in components can yield large variations in in-phase pickup. As long as this fact is recognized and the pickup value is within limits, an angle of maximum torque check would not be necessary. Clutch pressure must always be measured in the same manner. For example, some instruction books express clutch settings in both grams and current/voltage levels. Portable pre-calibrated reactance-resistance test boxes are available for many of these tests. The use of such equipment, properly applied, will yield results which will exceed in accuracy those obtained with conventional phase-angle meters, ammeters, voltmeters, etc. In addition to the tests previously described for the overcurrent relay, the directional unit should be tested for minimum pickup, angle of maximum torque, contact gap, and clutch pressure. Further, a test should be made to check that the overcurrent unit operates only when the directional unit contacts are closed. . Either test is valid, but to have comparative data, the same method, either grams or electrical quantities should be employed each time\n\n<strong>Voltage Relays </strong><strong>Secondary Injection Test\n</strong>Measure the relay auxiliary supply to ensure it is within the nameplate rating allowable range.\n\n<strong>Creep or Pickup Test</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Connect the voltage injector’s output.</li>\n \t<li>Adjust relay’s set points to the plant / substation recommended settings, if necessary.</li>\n \t<li>Set Red phase of voltage injector to 120% of relay setting.

Note: Set Yellow and Blue phase to zero.</li>\n \t<li>Inject Red phase voltage through the relay in order to record the tripping time. Check test results against the tripping curve characteristics of the relay.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Differential Relays</strong>\n\nA test of minimum pickup should be performed. The differential characteristic (slope) should be checked and where applicable the harmonic restraint should be tested. Generally, differential relays are extremely sensitive devices and require some special consideration. For example, those relays employing ultra-sensitive polarized units as sensing devices are slightly affected by previous his-tory such as heavy internal or external fault currents. To eliminate previous history and truly perform a maintenance test, it is the usual practice to disregard the first pickup reading and use the second reading for comparison with previous and future data. By \"disregard\" it is not meant to imply that the initial reading be forgotten; rather it is meant that this reading not be used for comparison purpose.\n\n<strong>Fuses</strong>\n\nThe fuse is a reliable overcurrent protective device, primarily used as a circuit protection device for over currents, overloads and short-circuits.\n\nA time-current characteristic curve, for any specified fuse, is displayed as a continuous line representing the average melting time in seconds for a range of overcurrent conditions.\n\nNFPA 70B recommends checking fuse continuity during scheduled maintenance, but testing to assure proper operation and protection against overcurrent conditions is not required. Fusible switches and fuse blocks require maintenance, such as tightening of connections and checking for signs of overheating as recommended per NFPA 70B.\n\nIn all cases, though, the idea is to send a small current through the fuse; if it passes through the fuse the fuse is good. If it does not the fuse is blown and needs replacement. This means that a battery is necessary to provide that small current and every fuse tester will have a battery in it.If a tester shows that a fuse is blown, the next step is to check the tester. This is accomplished by touching the test leads together or, in the case of testers without leads, to put a piece of metal (wire, coin, dinner spoon, anything metal) across the probes. If it does not indicate \"good\" the battery probably needs replacing.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Using a Continuity Tester</strong>\nContinuity testers will have two test leads and a small light that will light up if the leads are touched together. To test a fuse simply touch one lead to each of the electrical contacts on the fuse; if the light bulb lights up the fuse is good.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Testing a Fuse with a Multimeter</strong>\nA multimeter again has two leads just like a continuity tester. However, there are many settings on a multimeter to measure amperage, voltage and resistance in several different ranges. Some multimeters are auto ranging (no need to choose a range), some are digital and some are analog meters with a needle to indicate the reading. With all multimeters the first step is to set it to measure resistance, or Ω. If different ranges are available, choose the lowest range (K means thousand on the dial, so 2K equals 2000) - usually around 200. Like a continuity tester, touch one probe to each contact on a fuse and observe the reading. A very low w reading of 1 ohm or less means the fuse is good; if it is blown the reading will be infinite, or the maximum the meter will display. An intermediate reading of several ohms probably means you aren't making good contact; wriggle the probes on the fuse contacts or clean them and try again.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Motor Management Systems</strong>\n\nMicroprocessor-Based Motor Protection Takes Protecting and Monitoring Electric Motors into the Digital Age\n\nBefore microprocessor relays, electromechanical and solid state relays were tested on an element by element basis. This was a coherent approach, allowing individual parts of the relay to be calibrated and proven. When microprocessor relays arrived, many continued this approach and tested individual elements within the relay, while others found alternative methods to test. Developing automated testing procedures for microprocessor relays can be classified into three categories:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Element testing,</li>\n \t<li>Functional testing, and</li>\n \t<li>Black box testing.</li>\n</ul>\nThe black box testing method, is adequate in terms of NERC compliance.\n\nWhether functional or black box testing, the use of dynamic testing software is the logical choice to perform the testing. Dynamic tests drive relaying test sets to run in a series of defined sequences called states-such as pre-fault, fault and post-fault..\n\nThe use of element testing for microprocessor relays is likely to decline because, in part, to its noted shortcomings. The choice of functional vs. black box testing is less clear because both have their advantages and disadvantages. One thing is clear, however, regardless of the testing method employed-documentation of testing is critical, especially if the relay application is under the NERC umbrella. Tracking of testing intervals, previous test dates and last test dates are all part of the data required to be submitted during an audit. A detailed account of the testing on a subset of the full listing will often be requested. Maintaining this data by paper copy can result in much time spent tracking dates and data gathering. The larger the number of relays to track, the more daunting this task can be. Storage of all this data into a centralized database, with the ability to extract data and run audit reports, is quickly becoming a necessity to prepare for NERC audits. These reports can prevent a last minute crisis of discovering relays that were missed by tracking testing dates on a continual basis-and also provide the data needed for audit submissions. There are many different relay database programs, some home grown, others commercial. Regardless of NERC regulations, the reliance on these databases will only grow.\n\n<strong>Resetting Overcurrent Protective Devices</strong>\n\nCircuit breakers are sometimes selected over fuses because circuit breakers can be reset where fuses have to be replaced. The most time consuming activity that results from the operation of the overcurrent protective device is typically investigating the cause of the overcurrent condition.\n\nA known overload condition is the only situation that permits the immediate resetting or replacement of overcurrent protective devices per OSHA. If the cause for the operation of an overcurrent protective device is not known, the cause must be investigated.\n\nThus, having a device that can be easily reset, such as a circuit breaker, possibly into a fault condition, could be a safety hazard and a violation of OSHA regulations.\n\nBecause a fuse requires replacement by a qualified person, it is less likely to violate OSHA. Also, when an opened fuse is replaced with a new fuse in the circuit, the circuit is protected by a new factory calibrated device.\n\nGenerally, overload conditions occur on branch-circuit devices. Typically this is on lighting and appliance circuits feed from circuit breaker panel boards, where resetting of circuit breakers may be possible. Motor circuits also are subject to overload considerations.\n\nHowever, typically the device that operates is the overload relay, which can be easily reset after an overload situation. The motor branch-circuit device (fuse or circuit breaker) operates, as indicated in NEC® 430.52, for protection of short-circuits and ground-fault conditions. Thus, if this device opens, it should not be reset or replaced without investigating the circuit since it most likely was a short-circuit condition.\n\n<strong>User Benefits</strong>\n\nThe technical excellence and many unique features of the <a href=\"https://carelabs.me/protective-devices-testing-services/\">Protection Device Testers</a> translate directly into benefits for the user: -\n<ul>\n \t<li>optimum return on investment</li>\n \t<li>Standard control unit, reduces user training</li>\n \t<li>Impulse reproducibility</li>\n \t<li>Accurate measurement system delivers information about the SPD</li>\n \t<li>Integration into existing test facilities saves engineering costs</li>\n \t<li>Pass / Fail indication for individual samples, speeds up production</li>\n \t<li>High degree of automation, reduces operator workload</li>\n \t<li>Save operator time with the automated test routines and test report facility</li>\n \t<li>Easy integration into a full test suite</li>\n \t<li>Unparalleled reliability and system up-time</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "The motor acceleration system study is an important area in terms of electrical engineering.",
        "content": "The motor acceleration system study is an important area in terms of electrical engineering. It measures proper starting and running of motors on load with given system inertia without causing tripping or instability in the system. These studies are essential in determining the impact on system voltage during starting and in establishing whether the motor will start satisfactorily and come up to speed. The result of these studies allows engineers to start motors individually, use load transitioning to test the impact of fast bus transfer voltage, and enable load-group actions. In various electrical installations in industrial and commercial units, engineers are continuously verifying and stimulating motor acceleration systems to regulate whether they are working properly. The essential areas they must measure the starting, stopping and restarting of electrical motors.\n\nIf the system voltage drops to less than 75 per cent, all motors would drop from the bus and other sensitive loads may also trip. The elensol motor acceleration system study empowers engineers to measure thoroughly the impact of load changes to electrical systems. We check for any abnormal operating conditions, after the motor starting calculations completed. Our study will analyse minimal and overstressed devices and generate a summary of alerts. Our engineers execute the motor acceleration system studies by using state of art ETAP power system analysis software, allowing them to carry out testing operations and motor starting simulation techniques. This software enables our engineers to not only test the motor acceleration and starting, but also simulate dynamic motor models and motor starting equipment; check system voltage flicker; and take note of sequence starting, percent load transitioning and warning alarms.\n\nThe elensol motor acceleration system study features help engineers carry out motor starting evaluations, containing unlimited event scenarios so that various testing procedures carried out on multiple, different types of motors. This analysis empowers the engineers to compare the different responses on these motors to each other. Our motor acceleration system study lets engineers simulate load change of running motors, load tap changers and voltage regulators. Our expertise in motor acceleration analysis allows us for the easiest means of simulating motor acceleration and evaluating the results make improvements in the future operations of the electric motor. Another important feature of our motor acceleration system study is the ability to enter detailed pre-start conditions for motor generation and loading. Our motor acceleration system study allows engineers to execute the necessary evaluations, report on them and correct abnormalities all within the same system.\n\nThe starting electricity of most air conditioning motors is several times normal than full load current when starting them directly at full rated voltage. The starting force varies directly as the square of the applied voltage. Excessive starting current results in drop in terminal voltage and may result in the following:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Failure of motor starting due to low starting forces.</li>\n \t<li>Unnecessary operation of under voltage relays.</li>\n \t<li>Stalling of other running motors connected to the network.</li>\n \t<li>Voltage dips at the power sources and consequent flicker in the lighting system.</li>\n</ul>\nMotor starting studies will give choosing best method of starting, the proper motor design and the proper system design for minimizing the impact of the motor starting.\n\nAnalysis of motor starting methods performed by both static and dynamic simulation techniques as follows. These techniques have their own conveniences, advantages and drawbacks. We believe mainly in dynamic motor starting studies that reproduce observed motor starting conditions.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Load flow type solution with the perceived starting impedance of the motor modelled as part of network modelling</li>\n \t<li>Short circuit method type of calculations considering pre-fault short circuit conditions and using voltage drop calculations considering motor starting currents. Alternatively</li>\n \t<li>Where accurate dynamic model of the motor electric circuit and load – torque characteristics are available, dynamic model of the motor can use in traditional transient stability algorithm to assess the impact of the motor starting.</li>\n \t<li>Absence of proper model information, dynamic stability reviews can use where the observed starting electricity used as nodal injection at the motor bus as a dynamic event and the system response to this dynamic event measured.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>The various strategies described above can take into account, all types of motor starting such as </strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Direct on line</li>\n \t<li>With compensation</li>\n \t<li>Auto-transformers</li>\n \t<li>Soft Starters</li>\n \t<li>Start-Delta Start</li>\n \t<li>Performance curves supplied from manufacturer</li>\n \t<li>Variable frequency drives</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "Grounding System Design and Planning starts with a site analysis, collection of geographic data",
        "content": "Grounding System Design and Planning starts with a site analysis, collection of geographic data, and soil resistance of the area. Generally, the site engineer or equipment manufacturers specify a resistance to ground number. The National Electric Code states that the resistance to ground shall not exceed 25 ohms for a single electrode. However, great technology manufacturers will often state 3 or 5 ohms, depending upon the requirements of their equipment. For sensitive equipment and under extreme circumstances, a one ohm specification may sometimes be needed. When designing a ground system, the risk and cost increase exponentially as the target resistance to ground approaches the unobtainable goal of zero ohms.\n<h2><strong>Grounding System Data Collection</strong></h2>\nOnce a need established, data collection begins. Soil resistivity testing, geographical analysis and test borings would support grounding design. Soil resistivity test using the Wenner 4-point method  suggested due to its accuracy. This method will discuss later in this chapter. Additional data  always helpful and can collect from existing ground systems placed at the site. For example, driven rods at the place can test using the 3-point fall-of-potential method or an induced frequency test using a clamp-on ground resistance meter.\n<h2><strong>Grounding System </strong><strong>Data Analysis</strong></h2>\nWith all available data, smooth computer programs begin to give a soil model exhibiting the soil resistivity in ohm-meters and at various layer depths. Knowing at what depth the most conductive soil located for the site would allow the design engineer to design a system to meet essentials of application.\n<h2><strong>Grounding System Design</strong></h2>\nSoil resistivity is the important factor that regulates the resistance or execution of an electrical grounding system. It is the starting point of any electrical grounding design.\n<h2><b>Noise Discharge Path for Grounding System</b></h2>\nThis based on extensive belief that ground systems are a kind of “cesspool” into which unwanted electrical noises safely disposed. An approach defines that noise may “accumulate” if a big discharge path is not given. This is a false concept that is not based on sound electrical principles. Literally, noise or any unwanted signal will always take the path of lowest burden, a path which at high frequencies above 1 MHz is not the SRG but other nearby cables. The concept of the SRG as a noise discharge path based on fundamental misinterpretation of grounding principles.\n<h2><b>Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) Protection Using Grounding System</b></h2>\nElectrostatic discharge should concern to any data centre operator due to the risk of damage to equipment. The reason of data centres are usually maintained at high humidity such as 40% relative humidity is to obstruct formation of static charges. Floors in data centres should have static discharge treatment which may include the use of special fixed or raised floor tiles. Some data centres restrict the allowable footwear to prevent group from being efficient static generators. However, the SRG has no proper role in preventing creation of static charges or protecting equipment from these charges. The SRG cannot stop group from accumulating static charge. If an operator carries a static charge, the SRG cannot stop this charge from discharged into equipment.\n<h2><b>Human Safety by Proper Grounding System</b></h2>\nAnother generally held belief is that the SRG gives safety benefits relating to grounding and prevention of electric shock. It is genuine that proper grounding of electrical equipment is important to decrease the risk of electrical shock. It is true in 1970-1980 time periods some hard wired IT equipment in data centres was purposely wired without  safety ground,  to decrease noise interference. However, it is negligence of electrical codes to wire equipment without safety grounds and all pluggable equipment uses power cord that includes safety ground. Therefore, the determined ungrounding of equipment in data centres is non-existent in today’s data centre.\n\nIn a properly grounded data centre there is no problem with safety grounding that solved by the SRG. The SRG potentially give redundant safety ground, but this is not necessary or required. If unnecessary grounding system desired, it can effectively get by bonding the racks in a row to each other and running a ground wire back from the rack cabinets to the local PDU ground. Rack grounding in this way considered as “best practice” and effectively gets the same further safety benefits that SRG would give. The SRG, when properly deployed, is an unnecessary grounding system. Unnecessary grounding systems not need in the modern data centre, but even if desired there are more effective and less expensive ways to get unnecessary grounding system.\n\n&nbsp;",

        "content": "The current significant growth in electronic devices focusing providing our installations has given rise to a significant change in the last few years on the type of loads connected to the electrical distribution system. Not so long ago the only concern there was when using electricity at home, in establishments and productive centres was simply the voltage, without giving a thought to anything other than whether the equipment and devices were working or not.\n\nThese devices, present equipped electronics which in some way or another provide increased performance in the tasks and productive processes we carry out.\n\nEveryone uses computers for their personal use, for the process, control of any production system with variable speed drives, air conditioning units, lifts which adjust slowly on approaching the destination floor etc. These devices equipped with promoters, modulators and distort the current wave form for them to work properly.\n\n<b>Technical costs </b>are those which bring about a loss of performance on our installation.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Loss of capacity on energy distribution line</li>\n \t<li>Transformer overload</li>\n \t<li>Conductor overload</li>\n \t<li>Voltage drop</li>\n \t<li>Derating of transformers</li>\n \t<li>Losses on lines and machines due to the Joule's effect</li>\n \t<li>Magnetic losses on electrical machines</li>\n</ul>\nNormally, all technical cost turn into economic costs. Here is where importance of control in our installation.\n\n<b>Economic costs </b>are those which we can economically quantify, although in some cases it is difficult. These costs can  divide into <b>hidden cost </b>and <b>visible costs</b>.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Increased electricity consumption</li>\n \t<li>Electricity consumption peaks</li>\n \t<li>Surcharge or payment on reactive energy</li>\n \t<li>Distribution losses</li>\n \t<li>Power and energy loss (due to the Joule effect and magnets)</li>\n \t<li>Enlargement of the installations</li>\n \t<li>Stoppage of productive process</li>\n</ul>\nAll these phenomena can find to a lesser or greater extent depending on the installation itself and the loads connected.\n\n<strong>The main effects of the voltage and current harmonics in a power system can cited as:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>The chance for elaboration of some harmonics as a result of serial and parallel resonance.</li>\n \t<li>Performance reduction in generation, transport and energy usage systems.</li>\n \t<li>The aging of the grid insulation peripherals and as issue, energy reduction.</li>\n \t<li>Malfunctioning of the system or some of its elements.</li>\n</ul>\nHowever to understand these effects better we must know the nature of harmonics. Harmonics produced by not-linear loads that absorb non-sinusoidal current. The most common loads, both in industrial surroundings and domestic ones, are the following ones:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Frequency / Variable speed drives</li>\n \t<li>Discharge lamps (high pressure sodium vapour lamp, mercury vapour lamp, low consumption, fluorescent)</li>\n \t<li>Rectifiers</li>\n \t<li>AC/DC Converters</li>\n \t<li>Arc welding</li>\n \t<li>Induction ovens</li>\n \t<li>UPS</li>\n \t<li>Computers and laptops</li>\n</ul>\nHarmonics are contortion of the normal electrical waveform, generally transmitted by nonlinear loads. Switch-Mode Power supplies variable speed motors drives, photocopiers, personal computers, laser printers, fax machines, battery chargers and UPSs are examples of nonlinear loads.\n\nSingle phase nonlinear loads existing in modern office buildings, while three-phase nonlinear loads are common in organisations and industrial plants. A great section of the non-linear electrical load on most electrical distribution systems comes from Switch-Mode Power Supplies equipment. For example, all computer systems use Switch-Mode Power Supplies that convert utility Air Conditioner voltage to regulated low-voltage DC for internal electronics.\n\nThese non-linear power supplies consume electricity in high-amplitude short pulses that create significant distortion in the electrical and voltage wave shape harmonic distortion, measured as Total Harmonic Distortion. The exaggeration travels back into the power source and affect other equipment connected to the same source. Most power systems can take certain level of harmonic currents but will experience problems when harmonics become a significant element of the overall load. As great frequency harmonic electricity flow through power system, would cause communication errors, overheating and hardware damage such as:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Overheating of electrical distribution equipment, cables, transformers, standby generators etc.</li>\n \t<li>High voltages and circulating currents caused by harmonic resonance</li>\n \t<li>Equipment defect due to excessive voltage exaggeration</li>\n \t<li>High internal energy losses in connected equipment, causing component failure and shortened life span</li>\n \t<li>False tripping of branch circuit breakers</li>\n \t<li>Metering errors</li>\n \t<li>Fires in wiring and distribution systems</li>\n \t<li>Generator failures</li>\n \t<li>Crest elements and related problems</li>\n \t<li>Lower system element, resulting in fines on monthly utility bills</li>\n</ul>\nA standard transformer is not designed for high harmonic currents produced by non-linear loads. It will overheat and fail early when connected to these loads. When harmonics introduced into electrical systems at levels that showed adverse effects (about 1980), the industry responded by developing the K-rated transformer. K-rated transformers not meant for consonants, but they would handle heat produced by consonant electricity and efficiently used under their K-element value.\n\nK-element ratings range between 1 and 50. A standard transformer designed for linear loads have K-element of 1. The higher the K-element, the more heat from harmonic currents the transformer is able to handle. Making the right choice of K-element is very important, because it affects cost and safety. The table shows proper K-element ratings to use for different percentages of non-linear current in the electrical system.\n\nThe K-rated transformer commonly used in electrical industries, have more growth in transformer design that offer better performance in decreasing  voltage exaggeration and power losses due to electric consonants. Eaton’s energy-efficient Harmonic Mitigating Transformer designed to handle the non-linear loads of today's electrical infrastructures. This transformer uses electromagnetic reduction to deal exactly with the triplen (3rd, 9th, 15th etc.) consonants.\n\nSecondary windings of the transformer arranged to cancel zero sequence fluxes and ignore primary winding circulating currents. This transformer addresses the 5th and 7th consonant by using phase shifting. Using electromagnetic strategies, Eaton Harmonic Mitigating Transformer allows promote in same aspect as their operator designed them, while decreasing impact of consonants to energy losses and exaggeration. Eaton Harmonic Mitigating Transformer exceeds NEMA TP-1 efficiency standards, even when analysed with 100% nonlinear loads.\n\nWherever a K-rated transformer specified, an equal Harmonic Mitigating Transformer is a direct substitute. Power ware PDUs supplied with Harmonic Mitigating Transformer are efficient and effective at reducing the consonants produced by computer equipment and other nonlinear electronic loads.\n<h2><b>Advantages of using Power ware PDUs with Harmonic Mitigating Transformer</b></h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Prevents voltage flat-topping caused by non-linear loads</li>\n \t<li>Reduces upstream harmonic currents</li>\n \t<li>Eliminates transformer overheating and high operating temperatures</li>\n \t<li>Eliminates primary winding circulating current</li>\n \t<li>Saves energy by reducing harmonic losses</li>\n \t<li>Maintains high energy efficiency even under severe non-loading conditions</li>\n \t<li>Treats power quality harmonic issues that K-rated transformers do not address</li>\n \t<li>Suitable for high K-element loads without increasing in-rush current</li>\n \t<li>Improves power factor</li>\n</ul>",

        "content": "<h2><b>Load Flow Analysis / Power Flow Analysis</b></h2>\nPower systems across the world subjected to great demands owing to expansions in the networks. Rapid development of a nation in every sphere is interlinked with its power transmission capacity. This can be done by adding new lines and by upgrading existing ones by adding new devices like FACTS. A stable power transmission network ensures prosperity.\n\nVoltage instability in any network may lead to system collapse, when the bus voltage drops to such a level from which it cannot recover. In such a situation, complete system blackouts may take place. Hence voltage stability analysis is very important for successful process and planning of power system and for decreasing system losses. In this context, Load Flow or Power Flow Study and Analysis has been found useful by researchers in Voltage Stability Studies and Contingency Analysis.\n<h2><b>Voltage Stability</b></h2>\nVoltage stability is capacity of a power system to manage acceptable voltages at all buses in the system under normal conditions and after subjected to Voltage instability results in voltage collapse. Voltage collapse is the process by which the voltage falls to a low, unacceptable value as a result of an avalanche of events accompanying voltage instability. Voltage failure usually appears in power systems which usually heavy loaded failure and has reactive power shortages. In recent years voltage instability has attracted attention of power system planning and operating engineers as well as researchers. This is due to the frequent voltage collapses occurring in different parts of the world. Therefore Voltage Stability Analysis is important for researchers and power system planners to prevent such incidents from occurring.\n<h2><b>Voltage Stability Analysis</b></h2>\nThe different methods used are:\n<ul>\n \t<li>P-V curve method.</li>\n \t<li>V-Q curve method and reactive power reserve.</li>\n \t<li>Methods based on peculiarity of power flow Jacobean matrix at the point of voltage collapse.</li>\n \t<li>Continuation power flow method.</li>\n \t<li>Optimization Method</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>Load Flow Analysis</b></h2>\nTo begin the Voltage Stability Analysis of a power system, computation of the complex voltages at all the buses is essential. After this, power flows from a bus and the power flowing in all the transmission lines are to calculate. A computational tool for this purpose is Load Flow Analysis. This analysis helps compute the steady state voltage magnitudes at all the buses, for a particular load condition. Load flow is mainly used in planning studies, for designing a new network or expansion of an existing one. The next step would be to compare the calculated values of power flows and voltage with the steady state device limits, to estimate the health of the network\n<h2><strong>Load Flow Study</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Power flow analysis is very important in planning and designing the future expansion of power systems or addition to existing ones like adding new generator sites, meeting increase load demand and locating new transmission sites.</li>\n \t<li>The load flow solution yields the nodal voltages and the phase angles, the power injection, power flows and the line losses in a network.</li>\n \t<li>The best place, as well as the optimal capacity of a generating station, substation and new lines can regulate by load flow study.</li>\n \t<li>Minimization of System transmission losses and prevention of line overloads. The operating voltages of the buses being determined, it aids in voltage stability analysis and voltage levels at certain buses can keep within the closed tolerances. The power flow problem formulated assuming the power system network to linear, bilateral and balanced. However, the power and voltage constraints impose non-linearity in the power flow formulation and iterative techniques are essential for the solution. The different conventional techniques for solving the power flow problem are:</li>\n \t<li>Gauss-Seidel (GS) Method</li>\n \t<li>Newton Raphson (NR) Method</li>\n \t<li>Fast Decoupled Load Flow (FDLF)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><b>Voltage Stability and Line Compensation</b></h2>\nOne of the prime causes leading to voltage instability is reactive power imbalance in the power system network. This occurs when there is a sudden and unpredicted increase or decrease in reactive power demand in the system. Occurrence of voltage collapse can only be prevented by either reducing the reactive power load or by providing further supply of reactive power before the system reaches the point of voltage collapse. During situations of outage in some critical lines, the generators are capable of supplying limited reactive power. But in the process, the real powers of the generators compromised while supplying this reactive power. In long transmission lines, the line length and the degree of shunt compensation are the most important factors affecting the power frequency voltages under normal and fault conditions. An open-end or unloaded line experiences a rise in the receiving end voltage related to sinusoidal input voltage, known as Ferranti effect. On the other hand, an overloaded line experiences a sequential reduction in voltage leading to voltage collapse at the weakest bus. To stabilize the line voltage, reactive power (VAR) compensation required, which is control of reactive power to enhance power system network performance. The two important features of reactive power compensation are:\n<ol>\n \t<li>Load Compensation and</li>\n \t<li>Voltage Support.</li>\n</ol>\nThe aim of voltage support is to decrease the voltage variations at a given terminal of a transmission line.\n\nLine inductance compensation done by sequence capacitors and the line capacitance to earth by shunt reactors. Optimal placement of sequence capacitors are at different places along the line, when that of the shunt reactors is in the stations at the end of the line. In this way, the voltage drop/rise between the ends of the line can decrease both in amplitude and phase angle.",

        "content": "<em><strong>Carelabs is authorized provider of Electrical Installation’s Study, Analysis, Inspection, and Certification services in UAE, and offer voltage drop study and analysis services.</strong></em>\n\nDynamic voltage (IR) drop, in contrast to the static voltage drop depends on the switching activity of the design, and hence it is vector dependent.\n\nDesigning an ideal power grid which is robust across multiple operating scenarios of a chip continues to major challenge. The problem has magnified with technology shrinking allowing more performance to pack in a smaller area, from one node to another.\n\nThe power distribution on a chip needs to make sure circuit robustness catering to not only to the average power / current requirements, but also needs to make sure timing or accuracy not affected by Dynamic IR drop, caused by limited power demand and switching patterns.  Further, today’s devices power management techniques like power gating and switch power supplies are measures. In the case of switched power supplies, typically, power switch cells are uniformly distributed across the standard cell logic (logic gates) area of the floor plan.\n\nThere may further be sub-divisions in the switched power grid in the form of power domains, depending on the granularity of power gating. These power switches add further dimension to the power distribution problem as they often limit the response of the power grid to dynamic power or electrical needs. While the power distribution can improve easily by increasing the number of power switches, it has an impact on the off mode leakage (Iddq) and hence battery life in handheld applications.\n\nSo clearly, it is important to decrease the number of switches used as well as decrease the signal routing resources used on the power grid. Design closure and signoff (timing, IR Drop, EM, reliability etc.) comprehending Dynamic IR drop effects realistically. The factors provide cynicism in Dynamic voltage drop analysis should remove and must make sure the method power coverage of various silicon conditions and design operating scenarios. We then discuss power distribution and power grid planning method, and highlight the various aspects that need to take care of, from the early stages of design implementation. We give some of the systematic power grid enhancements like power automated switch placement and switched supply resistance minimization through DRC-aware power metal fill. All the analysis and results are based on production application of low power application processors for mobile devices.\n<h2><b>Static and Dynamic IR Drop</b></h2>\nStatic IR drop is average voltage drop for the design. While Dynamic IR drop depends on switching activity of the logic, therefore it is vector dependent. Dynamic IR drop depends on the switching time of logic and is less dependent on clock period. This nature illustrated in The Average current depends totally on the time period, while the dynamic IR drop depends on the instantaneous current which is higher while the cell is switching.\n\nStatic IR drop is good for closure analysis, in older technology nodes where enough natural decoupling capability from the power network and non-switching logic is available. While Dynamic IR drop measures IR drop caused when large amount of circuitry switch together, causing peak electricity demands. This electrical demand could highly localize and could brief within a single clock cycle (a few hundred PS) and could result in an IR drop that causes further setup or hold-time violations. Usually, high IR drop impact on clock networks causes hold time violations, while IR drop on data path signal nets results setup time violations.\n<h2><b>Dynamic Analysis on Power Grid</b></h2>\nA normal power grid and power switches designed for regular power. Usually, they designed for appropriate static IR drop objective and not for Dynamic IR drop. In the basic stage of the design, the grid power checks only with the Static IR drop result. This is because of late availability of use case scenarios (Voltage change dump (VCD) files). For the example, the switch and metal grid densities in the notches region can satisfy the static IR drop criteria, because the average power density in this region is not significant.\n\nWhen an application runs, gap area have higher power density due to limited switching in gap area and the switches combined with metal is not enough to support the electrical density in the gap area. Because of which have very high dynamic IR drop.  Here due to less number of switch cells combined with not so powerful grid is the main reason for high dynamic IR drop. As described by the figure, Switch Voltage drop and MET3 voltage drop are the dominant factors in the overall voltage drop. A similar analogy on the power density can extend to larger region.\n<h2><b>Dynamic IR Analysis</b></h2>\nDifficulties in analysing the dynamic IR impact on SOCs or complex designs is to get direction for enough scenarios and to get them in time to identify issues before the design tapes out. Our Early Analysis flow addresses this issue. In this flow, the switching activity of a sub IP integrated at the top level and switching activity at the top level created, for use in dynamic IR analysis. With the help of flow analysis, we are able to analyse architectural hot spots for dynamic IR drop, like crossbar collaborating shared memories having great power density.",

        "content": "The resistance of an earth electrode is related to the resistivity of the soil in which it is placed and driven, and thus soil resistivity calculations and measurements is a crucial aspect when designing earthing installations.\n\nThe property of resistivity can be defined for any material and is done so by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), which publishes standards for testing and measurement. When applied to soil, resistivity is an indication of a given soil’s ability to carry electric current.\n\nThe flow of electricity in the soil is largely electrolytic, determined by the transport of ions dissolved in moisture. An awareness of soil resistivity at the determined location and how it varies with various factors such as temperature, depth, moisture content etc. gives us an understanding of how the wanted earth resistance value should be obtained and retained over the lifespan of the installation with least cost and trouble.\n<h2>Why Testing the Soil Resistivity Important?</h2>\nA major aim of grounding system is to set up a shared reference potential for the building structure, power supply system, electrical conduits, plant steelwork, and the instrumentation system. To achieve this objective, a suitable low resistance connection to earth is desirable. However, this is often difficult to achieve and depends on a number of factors:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Soil resistivity</li>\n \t<li>Stratification</li>\n \t<li>Size and type of electrode used</li>\n \t<li>Deepness to which the electrode is covered</li>\n \t<li>Dampness and chemical composition of the soil</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The purposes of soil resistivity testing is:</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>To obtain a set of measurements which may be interpreted to yield an equivalent model for the electrical performance of the earth, as seen by the particular earthing system.</li>\n \t<li>Geophysical surveys are performed using these values as an assistance in finding depth to bedrock, core locations and other geological phenomena.</li>\n \t<li>The degree of corrosion in underground pipelines is determined. A drop in resistivity is proportional to an indent in corrosion in subversive pipelines.</li>\n</ul>\nSoil resistivity influences the plan of an earthing system absolutely and is the major factor that decides the resistance to earth of a grounding system. Thus before designing and installing a new grounding system, the determined location should be tested to find out the soil's resistivity.\n<table width=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"235\"><strong>Type of Soil or Water</strong></td>\n<td width=\"198\"><strong>Typical Resistivity </strong><strong>Ω</strong><strong>m</strong></td>\n<td width=\"166\"><strong>Usual Limit </strong><strong>Ω</strong><strong>m</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"235\">Sea water</td>\n<td width=\"198\">2</td>\n<td width=\"166\">0.1 to 10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"235\">Clay</td>\n<td width=\"198\">40</td>\n<td width=\"166\">8 to 70</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"235\">Ground well &amp; spring water</td>\n<td width=\"198\">50</td>\n<td width=\"166\">10 to 150</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"235\">Clay &amp; sand mixtures</td>\n<td width=\"198\">100</td>\n<td width=\"166\">4 to 300</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"235\">Shale, slates, sandstone etc.</td>\n<td width=\"198\">120</td>\n<td width=\"166\">10 to 100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"235\">Peat, loam &amp; mud</td>\n<td width=\"198\">150</td>\n<td width=\"166\">5 to 250</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"235\">Lake &amp; brook water</td>\n<td width=\"198\">250</td>\n<td width=\"166\">100 to 400</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"235\">Sand</td>\n<td width=\"198\">2000</td>\n<td width=\"166\">200 to 3000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"235\">Moraine gravel</td>\n<td width=\"198\">3000</td>\n<td width=\"166\">40 to 10000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"235\">Ridge gravel</td>\n<td width=\"198\">15000</td>\n<td width=\"166\">3000 to 30000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"235\">Solid granite</td>\n<td width=\"198\">25000</td>\n<td width=\"166\">10000 to 50000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"235\">Ice</td>\n<td width=\"198\">100000</td>\n<td width=\"166\">10000 to 100000</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n&nbsp;\n<h2>What is Done During the Testing of Soil Resistivity?</h2>\n<strong>Soil Resistivity varies widely with following factors:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Type of earth</li>\n \t<li>Stratification</li>\n \t<li>Moisture content; resistivity may fall rapidly as the moisture content is increased</li>\n \t<li>Temperature</li>\n \t<li>Chemical composition and concentration of dissolved salt.</li>\n \t<li>Presence of metal and concrete pipes, tanks, large slabs.</li>\n \t<li>Topography</li>\n</ul>\nThe results, if adequate investigation is not made prior to the test, or the test is not correctly undertaken, may be incorrect or misleading. To overcome these problems, the following data gathering and testing guidelines are suggested:\n<ul>\n \t<li>An initial research phase is required to provide adequate background, upon which to determine the testing program, and against which the results may be interpreted.</li>\n \t<li>Data related to nearby metallic structures, as well as the geological, geographical and meteorological nature of the area is very useful. For instance the geological data regarding strata types and thicknesses will give an indication of the water retention properties of the upper layers and also the variation in resistivity to be expected due to water content.</li>\n \t<li>By matching new rainfall data with seasonal average, minimum and maximum for the location it can be determined whether the results are accurate or not.</li>\n \t<li>Test Method Factors such as maximum probe depths, lengths of cables required, efficiency of the measuring technique, cost and ease of interpretation of the data need to be considered, when selecting the test type.</li>\n</ul>\n<em>Note: Temperature and moisture content both become more stable as distance below the surface of the earth increases. So, to be operative through the entire year, a grounding system should be fixed as deep as possible.</em>\n\n<strong>Following are the steps usually performed during soil resistivity testing:</strong>\n\n<strong>Test Method\n</strong>Factors such as maximum probe depths, lengths of cables required, efficiency of the measuring technique, cost (determined by the time and the size of the survey crew) and ease of interpretation of the data need to be considered, when selecting the test type. Three common test types are\n<ul>\n \t<li>Wenner Array: The Wenner array is the least efficient from an operational perspective. It requires the longest cable layout, largest electrode spreads and for large spacings one person per electrode is necessary to complete the survey in a reasonable time. As all 4 electrodes are shifted after every analysis, the Wenner Array is most vulnerable to lateral variations.</li>\n \t<li>Schlumberger Array: Manpower is hugely utilised with the Schlumberger array as for each move of the inner electrodes, the outer electrodes are moved four or five times. The decrease in the number of electrode shifts also decreases the consequence of lateral variation on end outcomes. Considerable time saving can be achieved by using the reciprocity theorem with the Schlumberger array when contact resistance is a problem.</li>\n \t<li>Driven Rod Method: The driven rod method (or Three Pin or Fall-of-Potential Method) is normally suitable for use in circumstances such as transmission line structure earths, or areas of difficult terrain, because of: the shallow penetration that can be achieved in practical situations, the very localised measurement area, and the inaccuracies encountered in two layer soil conditions.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Traverse Locations.</strong>\n\nSoil resistivity can differ considerably both from 1 location to another and depth at a site, and single soil resistivity quantity is generally insufficient. To get an improved image of soil resistivity difference, it is sensible to perform a thorough survey. A Line Traverse survey is inexpensive and easy to find differences in soil resistivity at a location and can give considerable money savings, in terms of labour and material, when trying to obtain the necessary resistance value.\n\n<strong>Spacing Range.</strong>\n\nThe limit of spacing determined involves précises close probe spacings i.e. less than 1m, which are necessary to find out the upper layer resistivity, utilised in quantifying the touch and step voltages. Bigger spacings are utilised in quantification of grid impedance and remote voltage gradients. Calculations at huge spacings usually provide significant problems and they are vital if the bottom layer is of bigger resistivity, i.e. ρ2 &gt; ρ1. In such cases considerable error is introduced if a realistic value of ρ2 is not measured due to insufficient spacing.\n<h2>Practical Testing Recommendations.</h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>It has been found that special care is required when testing to:</li>\n \t<li>Eliminate mutual coupling or interference due to leads parallel to power lines.</li>\n \t<li>Ensure the instrumentation and set up is adequate</li>\n \t<li>Undertake operational checks for accuracy</li>\n \t<li>Reduce contact resistance</li>\n \t<li>Instruct staff to use finer test spacing in areas showing sharp changes</li>\n \t<li>Plot test results immediately during testing to identify such problem areas</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How is Soil Resistivity Testing Performed?</h2>\nThis test requires the user to place four equally spaced auxiliary probes into the earth to determine the actual soil resistance, traditionally in ohms-cm or ohm-m. This test must take place around the entire area to determine the soil value at all locations. This test is done at different spacing, 5 to 40 feet, to determine the resistance value at various depths. This knowledge will aid in the design and implementation of the correct ground system to meet the particular site requirements. Following are the steps done in measuring soil resistivity:\n<ul>\n \t<li>4 test rods are evenly placed apart in a straight line and are hammered into the ground to be reviewed to a deepness of not greater than one by twentieth of the distance between the neighbouring rods.</li>\n \t<li>An earth resistance tester is connected to these four stakes.</li>\n \t<li>The DC test option on the tester is then selected and performed, and the resistance figure R recorded.</li>\n \t<li>The soil resistivity level r in ohms/cm is then found out using the formula:\n<ul>\n \t<li>r = 2 ρaR</li>\n \t<li>where: R = the resistance figure (in ohms), a = the separation of the test stakes, in metres.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",

        "content": "Circuit Breaker Testing is utilised to test the operation of each switching systems and the programming of the entire tripping structure. Circuit Breaker Testing is essential to ensure the safe and reliable performance of this key link in the power asset chain. Circuit breakers perform <strong>three main tasks</strong>:\n<ul>\n \t<li>They should conduct the current as efficiently as achievable, when closed.</li>\n \t<li>When open, they must insulate the contacts from one another as effectively as possible.</li>\n \t<li>In the event of a malfunction, they must disconnect the fault current as quickly and reliably as possible, thereby protecting all subsequent equipment.</li>\n</ul>\nPerforming circuit breaker testing is more challenging with comparison to other electrical components like transformer as the short circuit current is greater.  In the US market and regions of frequent earthquakes, the most popular high-voltage circuit breakers are \"dead tank\" units, whereas in central Europe \"live tank\" breakers are standard. Elsewhere both circuit breaker types are obtainable.\n<h2><strong>Why is Testing Circuit Breaker Important</strong><strong>?</strong></h2>\nA circuit breaker might stay idle years, but if a malfunction occurs it has to detach fault currents of huge kiloamps gradually within a few milliseconds. Major errors that happen on circuit breakers are incorrect behavior, short circuits in the coils, damage/wear to the mechanical connections or the insulation material. Therefore, circuit breakers need to be regularly and carefully tested. Circuit breakers perform a vital role in <strong>protecting expensive equipment from damage through faults</strong> i.e. connecting and disconnecting the electrical power in a reliable way; this requires proving their reliability with on field tests during installation and with regular maintenance tests during its lifetime to prevent costly failures and problems that could even compromising the safety of the substation. Testing the performance of your circuit breakers regularly is therefore an essential and cost-effective part of any maintenance strategy. Circuit breaker testing particularly concentrates on obtaining motion and time values on the units. However, our testing solutions have revolutionized circuit breaker testing. Performing the tests without use of the station battery greatly increases safety throughout the testing process. <strong> </strong>\n<h2><strong>What are the Steps in Circuit Breaker Testing?</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Type Tests of circuit breaker</strong></h3>\nType tests are organised with the aim of proving the abilities and making sure the rated characteristic of the circuit breaker are exact. Such tests are conducted in the specially built testing laboratory.\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Mechanical Test</strong>– It is mechanical ability type test involving the repeated opening and closing of the breaker. A circuit breaker must close and open at proper speed and do its allocated job and function without any failure.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Thermal Test</strong>– Thermal tests are carried out to check the thermal behavior of the circuit breakers. Due to the streaming of rated current through its pole in a rated condition, the breaker under test undergoes steady-state temperature rises. The temperature rise for rated current should not exceed 40° for current less than 800A normal current and 50° for normal value of current 800A and above.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Dielectric Test</strong>– These tests are performed to check power frequency and impulse voltage withstand capacity. Power frequency tests are kept on a new circuit breaker; the test voltage changes with a circuit breaker rated voltage. In impulse tests, impulse voltage of particular value is employed to the breaker. For outdoor circuit dry and wet tests are conducted.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Short -Circuit Test</strong>– Circuit breakers are subjected to sudden short-circuits in short-circuit test laboratories, and oscillograms are taken to know the behaviour of the circuit breakers at the time of switching in, during contact breaking and after the arc extinction. The oscillograms are studied with particular reference to the making and breaking currents, both symmetrical and asymmetrical restriking voltages, and switchgear is sometimes tested at rated conditions.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><strong> </strong><strong>Routine Tests of a Circuit Breaker</strong></h2>\nRoutine tests are done as per references of standards of Indian Engineering Service and Indian Standards. These tests are performed on the manufacturers’ premises. Routine tests confirm the proper functioning of the circuit breaker. The routine tests confirm the proper functioning of the circuit breaker. Routine testing doesn’t necessarily include complex gear in order to ensure that a circuit breaker is functional.  Some guidelines and recommendations for these tests include routine maintenance and verifying that that circuit breaker performance is in line with manufacture’s calibration curves.  It is crucial that these tests are performed under stable conditions at suitable temperature so that there are no variations in the data.  Some of the tests are listed below.\n<h3><strong>Preventative Maintenance of Circuit Breaker, Inspection, and Testing</strong></h3>\nPreventative maintenance depend operating conditions for circuit breakers.  Primary inspections of CB (circuit breakers) will look at particulate matter that’s contaminating the inner workings of the CB.  Accumulation of particulates can generally be disposed of by flipping the lathe on the breaker “Off” and “On” switch to clear away the accumulated dust\n<h3><strong>Circuit Breaker Trip Test</strong></h3>\nBy analysing the current consumed by the trip coil during the circuit breaker’s operation, it is possible to determine whether there are mechanical or electrical issues present. In many cases, such issues can be localised to aid in finding the root cause. Optionally, monitoring the tripping supply’s voltage during the operation can detect issues arising with tripping batteries.\n<h3><strong>Insulation Resistance Test</strong></h3>\nFor individual breaker resistance testing, load and line conductors should be preferably disconnected. If not detached the test values will also involve the characteristics of the connected circuit.  Resistance testing is crucial for verifying that the insulating material which makes up the molded cases breakers are performing correctly.  In order to test for insulation resistance, an instrument known as a megger is used. A megger instrument applies a known DC voltage to a given wire for a given period of time in order to test the resistance within the insulation on that particular wire or winding.  It is vital that voltage is employed as the resistance checked with an ohmmeter may differ when there are no report of potential differences.  It should also be noted that if you apply a voltage that is too high for that insulation to withstand, then you could potentially damage the insulation.\n<h3><strong><u>Connection Tests</u></strong></h3>\nConnection testing is important to make sure that an appropriate electrical connection is available and to recognise traces of overheating denoted by colour difference.  It is important that electrical connections are properly installed to the CB to prevent and reduce overheating.\n<h3><strong>Contact Resistance Test</strong></h3>\nNormal wear and tear of contacts within the CB emerges after extended usage.  An easy method to identify traces of weakening within the circuit breaker is to quantify the resistance across every pole of the breaker. Indications of abnormal conditions within the CB such as erosion and contamination of contacts are evident if there are excessive millivolt drops across the breaker.  The contact resistance test is important in finding out if or not a circuit breaker is still apt for functioning.\n<h3><strong>Overload Tripping Test</strong></h3>\nOverload tripping components of CBs can be tested by inputting 300% of the breaker rating into each pole of the circuit breaker to determine that it will open automatically.  The motive of this is to make sure that the circuit breaker will operate or not.  Refer to NETA standards for trip times that are acceptable for the overload tripping test.  When trying to find out tripping characteristics, it is advisable to consult with manufacturer’s manuals.\n<h3><strong>Instantaneous Magnetic Tripping</strong></h3>\nIn routine tests, it is relevant to find out that the magnetic feature is functional and will trip the circuit breaker instead of finding the precise value at which the instantaneous magnetic feature functions.\n<h2>How Testing of Circuit Breaker is Performed?</h2>\nDifferent circuit breaker test equipment are used to check the operation and condition of circuit breakers on the power systems. How to test a circuit breaker involves many different test techniques and type of testers. This will define how to test a circuit breaker through different testing tools to be applied to check the equipment under a range of conditions or operation types. Discover how to test a circuit breaker with the different test sets that you can need.\n<h3><strong>Testing with Different Equipment:</strong></h3>\nTo consider how to test a circuit breaker, it is required a deep knowledge of the breaker itself:\n<ul>\n \t<li>How it works</li>\n \t<li>Its tolerances,</li>\n \t<li>Reference values of previous tests,</li>\n \t<li>Initial values with which to compare the actual results, sometimes defined by a rated timing graph,</li>\n \t<li>Established settings or initial features given by manufacturer</li>\n</ul>\nIn this sense, how to test a circuit breaker becomes a trending analysis since test results are not always definitive but have meaning just when compared to previous data or results.\n<h3>Testing with Circuit Breaker Analyzer</h3>\nThe timing tests of the different open and close operations of the breaker is an efficient way of how to test a circuit breaker, analyzing not only the trip times but also the essential synchronism of the poles in the different operations. This define how to test a circuit breaker through different simulations of its operation, which can be directly commanded from the circuit breaker analyzer, or initiated by an external signal, checking the opening or closing time of each pole, in single or combined operations, and checking the possible difference between poles or mismatch time which may lead to a dangerous lack of synchronism. How to test a circuit breaker with a circuit breaker analyzer depends also on the type of possible problems to be confirmed, which leads to check other features such as the possible bouncing, the proper performance of the pre-insertion resistances, the coils condition, and the mechanical analysis through contact travel speed and acceleration data with the use of the appropriate transducers.\n<h3>Testing with a Micro-ohmmeter</h3>\nCircuit breakers generally bear a huge value of current. Greater contact resistance cause greater losses, low current carrying capability and threatening hot spots in the breaker, so that the resistance testing with micro-ohmmeters are other way of how to test a circuit breaker for identifying and avoiding upcoming issues. How to test a circuit breaker with a micro-ohmmeter requires also reliable measurements and a wide injection range with high power that enables for longer test leads, less connections problems, and more accurate measurements.\n<h3>Testing with a High Current Primary Injection Tester</h3>\nThe analysis of the tripping time characteristics of LV circuit breakers and molded-case circuit breakers is performed using high current injection, as the way to check the entire functionality. How to test a circuit breaker of this type depends on its maximum rated current, the trip protection settings and the inverse curve types which will define the overload and short-circuit trip pickup levels and time delays; all these features must be checked with the appropriate primary injection test set with the capacity to simulate the corresponding high current faults required and capture the answer of the breaker. A system which be easily upgraded in power capacity enables how to test a circuit breaker in the different possible situations and range of breakers; how to test a circuit breaker of this kind also needs a bendable design of the test set to fruitfully attain the certain large current job, and a design that create possible to position it nearer to the breaker, and so decreasing the power needed with smaller test leads; this is the case of the Raptor System, a modular and flexible primary injection system which easily and quickly adapts its power capacity to the several high currents ratings of the different circuit breakers.\n<h2>Benefits of Circuit Breaker Testing</h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Quick and easy to perform on site</li>\n \t<li>Circuits can be tested on or off load</li>\n \t<li>Tests performance of whole tripping cycle</li>\n \t<li>Tests overall timing of tripping system</li>\n \t<li>Identifies need for maintenance</li>\n \t<li>Part of a comprehensive diagnostic maintenance program</li>\n \t<li>Find early indications of possible problems</li>\n \t<li>Avoid issues other than pick up pieces</li>\n \t<li>Build up a test record database for trending</li>\n \t<li>Pick out the bad actors</li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;",

        "description": "Electric Motor Testing is usually the first thing to be sacrificed when cutting back on operational expenses.",
        "content": "Electrical maintenance programs are designed to increase equipment promptness and uptime while decreasing capital operating cost. Electric Motor Testing is usually the first thing to be sacrificed when cutting back on operational expenses. But smart companies, understands that without proper maintenance programs, there is billions of dollars of lost revenue through increased motor repair costs, downtime, and waste in industrial and commercial companies.\n<h2><strong>Why is Electric Motor Testing Done?</strong></h2>\nAfter bearing failure, electrical faults are the most common mode of motor failure, so in addition, a properly planned electrical testing scheme is important for making sure of the plant reliability. The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) conducted a survey which brought into the light that, 48% of motor failures are because of electrical failures. The 48% can be again divided into rotor problems (12%) and winding problems (36%). The other 52% of failures are mechanical faults.\n\nMany diagnostic tools, such as clamp-on ammeters, temperature sensors, a Megger or oscilloscope, can help illuminate these issues.\n\nWinding defects occurs due to contamination, ageing of insulation, thermal overload, power surges, damaged wire/materials, and other causes. They start as energy crossing an insulation fault like moisture, which sets apart at least one turn. This creates extra stress and increase in temperature across the fault, which increases until the winding fails.\n<h3>Some of the winding faults are:</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Between turns in a coil</li>\n \t<li>Between coils in a phase</li>\n \t<li>Between coils in different phases</li>\n \t<li>Between a coil or phase and ground</li>\n</ul>\nFault finding of at least one of the above can save your facility countless hours of shut down and numerous dollars in savings.\n<h2><strong>What is Done During Electric Motor Testing?</strong></h2>\n<h3>There are various kinds of testing done on motor. They are:<strong><u> </u></strong></h3>\n<strong>Electric Motor Impulse Testing\n</strong>Electric Motor impulse testing is an integral part of predictive maintenance of electrical motors. Below are few questions that helps in explaining the influence of extensive impulse testing on a motor.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Can impulse testing damage healthy or deteriorated insulation?</li>\n \t<li>Can DC Resistance, Inductance, Megger or HiPot tests diagnose weak turn-to-turn insulation?</li>\n \t<li>After failing an impulse test, are motor with weak insulation able to operate?</li>\n \t<li>Are motors with a turn-turn short able to perform continued function?</li>\n</ul>\nThis was accomplished by putting a low voltage motor through extensive testing rigors, until inducing a failure. Following the failure, additional testing investigated the possible deteriorating effects on turn-turn insulation due to impulse testing beyond the motor’s dielectric breakdown. NOTE: This paper was edited from the original version of the IEEE paper published in 2003.\n\n<strong>Electric Motor Rotation Testing\n</strong>Check for fan or pump motor rotation when testing offline with the MCE. Fans may continue to slowly rotate due to drafting in the Plenum. Pumps that are attached to a shared header might remain rotating if other pumps attached to the header are functioning. This will adversely affect the Standard Test results, possibly creating higher than normal resistive and inductive imbalances.\n\n<strong>Wound Rotor Electric Motor Testing\n</strong>Wound rotor motors have a three-phase winding wound on the rotor which is connected to three phases of start-up resistors to provide current and speed control on start-up. Failed components in the resistor bank are common and often overlooked when troubleshooting. These damages can have major influence on the complete functioning of the motor and must be provided significant attention when troubleshooting these motors.\n\n<strong>Electric Motor Insulation Resistance Testing\n</strong>Electric motor insulation exhibits a negative temperature coefficient, meaning as temperature increases, resistance decreases. This will make you certain that insulation resistance of a de-energized motor will reduce after commencing the motor. However, most often the resistance will initially increase after running due to moisture being evaporated by the increasing temperature of the windings. The standard IEEE43 on insulation resistance testing needs a temperature rectification to forty degrees Celsius, which could instantly turn suitable measured resistance readings into disappointingly low rectified resistance readings. Before sending a motor to be renovated, consider space heaters.\n\n<strong>Meg-ohm Test\n</strong>The meg-ohm test has long been the tool of choice for most engineers, and this simple test is often the only electrical test performed on a motor. However, while the meg-ohm test has a valid role to play, it is simply not capable of detecting all the likely faults within a motor’s winding.\n\n<strong>PC tests\n</strong> Modern test equipment utilises PC control to provide automatic testing and fault diagnosis, thus removing the responsibility on the operator to interpret the results. The equipment can detect micro arcs, and to stop the test automatically. Database software permits resources to be saved with all test outputs, so that a practise can be built up with time, preferably from the inauguration of first-hand motor. Automated testing also helps remove operator error, inconsistency created by different operators applying different parameters and the possibility of the operator applying over-voltage to the motor. The latest testers combine all static electrical tests within one portable device, which also can create professional test reports.\n\n<strong>Static or Insulation Testing\n</strong>It is performed with the motor disconnected from the power supply. It is particularly done from the motor control cabinet and must be performed in a predetermined test sequence.\n\n<strong>Winding Resistance Test\n</strong>It will highlight dead shorts, loose connections and open circuits. Such tests must be performed with accurate equipment, which can measure down to 0.001 ohm. It is extremely important to correct the resistance values to a constant temperature, typically 20 degrees Celsius. The motor temperature should be quantified as precisely as achievable, and the copper temperature should be utilised wherever possible. A motor that has been recently operating is very unlikely to be at ambient temperature, so the use of ambient temperatures should be avoided. Upon conclusion of the test, the one imbalance between the phase-to-phase readings are quantified.\n\n<strong>DC Step Voltage Test<u>\n</u></strong>It is typically performed at twice line voltage plus 1000 volts. The voltage is increased in a series of steps, and the leakage current is plotted. Effective insulation to earth will denote a linear plot, whereas a non-linear plot will indicate an insulation deterioration at that voltage where the leakage current instantly amplified. The step voltage test provides a great deal more information than the basic DC hipot test.\n\n<strong>DC Hipot Test<u>\n</u></strong>Simply applies a voltage, measures leakage current and calculates meg-ohms. If the meg-ohms are greater than the acknowledged smallest estimate, the motor passes. Even if there is an area of damaged insulation which causes a lower reading of meg-ohms, if that value is higher than the minimum accepted value, it will still pass.\n\n<strong>Surge Test\n</strong>This test is used to verify the turn-to-turn, coil-to-coil and phase-to- phase insulation condition and is typically performed at twice line voltage plus 1000 volts. It can identify dead shorts, frail insulation, unbalances and loose connections caused by incorrect winding. It works by injecting high voltage pulses into each phase, creating a potential difference between one turn and the next. The resulting sine waves from every phase must equal 1 another.\n\n<em><strong>The above-mentioned tests are offline tests.</strong></em>\n\n<strong>Dynamic Motor Testing or online Testing</strong>\nA more recent addition to electrical testing technologies, this involves measuring the voltage and current of the motor’s three phases, while the motor is functioning in its usual setting, and quantifying a host of data related to, the motor, the power supply and the load. Both electrical and mechanical issues can be identified.\n\nPower quality values, including voltage level, unbalance and distortion are determined and compared to industry standards. Bad power quality can point to rise in temperature within motors, and as heat is the greatest enemy of insulation power quality problems must be determined and rectified where possible.\n<h2><strong>The Recommended Off-line in-Service Electric Motor Tests are</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Stator winding resistive imbalance</li>\n \t<li>Stator winding insulation resistance (Meg-Ohm checks)</li>\n \t<li>Polarization Index (PI)</li>\n \t<li>Step Voltage test</li>\n \t<li>Surge test</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>The Recommended Spare Electric Motor Tests are</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Stator winding resistive imbalance</li>\n \t<li>Stator winding insulation resistance (Meg-Ohm checks)</li>\n \t<li>Polarization Index (PI)</li>\n \t<li>Step Voltage test</li>\n \t<li>Surge test</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>The Recommended New/Refurbished Electric Motor Tests are</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Stator winding resistive imbalance</li>\n \t<li>Stator winding insulation resistance (Meg-Ohm checks)</li>\n \t<li>Polarization Index (PI)</li>\n \t<li>Step Voltage test</li>\n \t<li>Surge test</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>How is Motor Testing Done?</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Three Phase</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Make sure the link for power supply is in decent state.

        "description": "A ground fault is any short circuit that outcomes in an unintentional connection amid a ground",
        "content": "A ground fault is any short circuit that outcomes in an unintentional connection amid a ground and energized ungrounded phase conductor and ground. Ground faults are the most common type of fault on power distribution systems. They are due to the insulation failure or accidental grounding of an ungrounded phase conductor that causes the ungrounded phase conductor to meet ground. Unintentional grounding of a phase conductor can occur when a small animal enters a piece of equipment and contacts both an ungrounded phase conductor and the grounded enclosure. They monitor that the current going out any one phase is coming back on another phase or neutral. If current is going out on a phase but is coming back on the ground path a ground fault has occurred. All systems with ground fault protection include:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Current transformers to identify ground fault current(GFC)</li>\n \t<li>A relay or logic box to determine tripping current value and time</li>\n \t<li>An operating mechanism to trip the breaker or switch</li>\n</ul>\nCertain systems have a monitor panel indicating system status and a test panel for generating a ground fault signal to test the breaker.\n<h2><strong>Why Testing Ground Fault Systems is Important? </strong></h2>\nAccording to National Electrical Code (NEC) sections 230-95 and 517-17 performance testing is required. Around 16% of ground fault protection systems tested by NETA comprises of components which are not installed properly, damaged components or does not operate properly. Arcing ground faults can seriously damage distribution equipment, causing fires, which damage facilities and endanger personnel. They also cause extended downtime during system repair. Ground fault protection is the initial step of shield. Once installed, ground fault protection systems stand by until needed to protect services and feeders. However, if these systems malfunction when a ground fault occurs, the distribution system and facility will be as damaged as if no systems were installed. Ground fault systems must be fitted correctly and maintained and tested periodically. An arcing ground fault of even small values spoil switchgear before the main service overcurrent protection gets time to operate. A 480V solidly grounded system possess enough voltage to support an arc between 1 phase and a ground, but not adequate current to cause big main breaker or fuse to eradicate the fault rapidly. The result of this is an arc that is like an electric weld, munching huge values of metal during the time the breaker or fuse functions. A correctly installed and functioning ground fault protection system will identify and eradicate the fault in milliseconds, speedy enough to regulate damage to satisfactory levels.\n<h3><strong>Few Points to Remember</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Complete field acceptance testing as required by the NEC</li>\n \t<li>Inspect neutral main bonding connection</li>\n \t<li>Verify proper installation of sensor(s) and grounding connections</li>\n \t<li>Inject current through the current sensor and verify pickup and timing characteristics of the relay</li>\n \t<li>Test operation with control voltage supply decreased to 277V as an alternative of 480V</li>\n \t<li>Verify functioning of exclusive features like zone interlocks</li>\n</ul>\nNEC Article 100 defines ground fault protection of equipment as, “A system envisioned to give safety of equipment from harming line to ground fault currents by functioning to bring about a detaching means to open whole ungrounded conductors of the faulted circuit. This protection is offered at current levels smaller than those needed to shield conductors from harm through the functioning of a supply circuit overcurrent device.” Ground-Fault Sensing and Relaying Equipment requires that manufacturers provide information sheets describing system testing instructions. As a minimum, UL requires the following performance testing for manufacturers’ test requirements:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Have a trained personal examine the ground fault protection system to safeguard that it was fixed properly according to manufacturer’s recommendations. - Verify that the location of sensors and the polarity of their connections are correct.</li>\n \t<li>Detect system grounding points to ensure that no ground paths occur that would sidestep the sensors.</li>\n \t<li>Test the ground fault protection system using either a simulated or actual controlled ground fault to determine that the system settings are correct and that the system is operating as intended.</li>\n \t<li>Record the results of the performance testing on the manufacturer-provided test form.</li>\n</ul>\nIn addition, NEMA Publication PB 2.2 requires the following for performance testing:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Manufacturer’s installation and instruction literature should be reviewed and understood prior to performance testing.</li>\n \t<li>Performance testing should follow manufacturer’s recommendations.</li>\n \t<li>Performance testing must be regulated to those tests that find out that the ground fault system has been fixed properly and is functional.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>What is Done During Testing of Ground Fault System?</strong></h2>\nThere are two test methods for evaluating ground fault protection systems by using simulated fault current or by high-current primary injection. These methods can be applied to ground-fault relay systems, but to test a system with integral ground-fault trip circuit breakers, only the high-current primary injection method can be utilized. If the high-current test does not create necessary tripping, verify control power at fuses, transformers and at relays. The ground fault relay systems can be tested by the simulated fault current testing method plus a detailed visual inspection, if it is suitable to the local inspection agencies. Or else, it will be essential to utilize the high current primary injection test method.\n<h3><strong>Simulated Fault Current Method</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>A simulated fault current is created by a coil round a window type sensor or with the help of a distinct test winding in the sensor.</li>\n \t<li>A secondary current in the sensor is created, when the monitor panel sends a small current through the test winding, which the relay act in response to as if it were created by a primary current of thousand six hundred amperes.</li>\n \t<li>In a similar method which can be utilized with any window type sensor providing a ground fault relay, number of twists of wire are covered round the sensor core, like twenty turns of #14 wire.</li>\n \t<li>A current is passed through the wire to simulate the ground-fault current, which is approximately 125 percent of the pickup setting of the relay divided by the number of turns</li>\n \t<li>Testing with simulated fault current offers a way of explaining the functioning of the relay, sensor and shunt trip and the sufficiency of the control power supply.</li>\n \t<li>GFP system must be checked to confirm. that neutral ground points are placed properly with regard to sensors, that sensor polarities are correct when several are connected in parallel, and that conductors which pass through a sensor window all run in the same direction.</li>\n \t<li>The significance of adding simulated fault current testing with sufficient inspection is highlighted when 1 understands that the first 5 items on the Checklist are problems that cannot be identified by just simulated fault current testing only.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>High-Current Primary Injection Method</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>The high-current injection test method might be used to test ground fault protection systems with integral ground fault trips on circuit breakers or ground fault relays.</li>\n \t<li>It is an alternative to simulated fault current testing along with inspection in the case of relays.</li>\n \t<li>Integral ground fault protection in circuit breakers can be system tested only with the help of high-current injection test method.</li>\n \t<li>No. TAK-TS2, which is utilized along with AKR-SST/ECS trips can be used to determine the internal electronics of these breakers.</li>\n \t<li>High-current testing of ground fault protection systems comprises of injecting full-scale current into the equipment phase and neutral conductors to replicate the ground fault current flow under various states.</li>\n \t<li>The testing gear needed consists of a high-current supply sufficient enough to deliver up to thousands of amperes or more at 2.5V, or similar.</li>\n \t<li>With the help of smaller ground fault current pickup settings on relays and breakers or switches, the current necessary to trip can be maintained to a minimum, such as 400 or 300 amperes or less.</li>\n \t<li>If inspection experts needs tests at complete ground fault protection setting, a current supply sufficient enough to deliver thousand two hundred amperes or more may be necessary.</li>\n \t<li>Connect the current supply and jumpers between the points indicated in the tables accompanying the diagrams.</li>\n \t<li>Ground fault protection can be supplied for three wires and four wire gear supplied from a solidly grounded four wire supply.</li>\n \t<li>This is necessary to offer a low-impedance ground fault current return path to the neutral to make sure functioning of the overcurrent device is correct.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong> </strong> <strong>How is Ground Fault Test Performed?</strong></h2>\n<h3><strong>Visual and Mechanical Inspection</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Compare nameplate data of equipment with specifications and drawings.</li>\n \t<li>Inspect the components for damage and errors in polarity or conductor routing:</li>\n \t<li>Verify that ground connection is made ahead of the neutral disconnect link and on the line side of any ground fault sensor.</li>\n \t<li>Verify that the neutral sensors relate to correct polarity on both primary and secondary.</li>\n \t<li>Verify that all phase conductors and the neutral pass through the sensor in the same direction for zero sequence systems.</li>\n \t<li>Check that grounding conductor does not pass through the 0 sequence sensors.</li>\n \t<li>Verify that the grounded conductor is solidly grounded.</li>\n \t<li>Inspect bolted electrical connections for high resistance using one of the following methods:</li>\n \t<li>Use of low-resistance ohmmeter in accordance with Section 7.14.2.</li>\n \t<li>Check stiffness of reachable bolted electrical connections by calibrated torque wrench method according to manufacturer’s published data.</li>\n \t<li>Perform thermographic survey.</li>\n \t<li>Verify correct operation of all functions of the self-test panel.</li>\n \t<li>Verify that the control power transformer has adequate capacity for the system.</li>\n \t<li>Set time-delay and pickup settings according to the settings given in the owner’s specifications. As asked by NFPA, record suitable functional and test sequences.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Electrical Tests</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Perform resistance measurements through bolted connections with a low-resistance ohmmeter, if applicable.</li>\n \t<li>Measure the system neutral-to-ground insulation resistance with the neutral disconnect link temporarily removed.

        "content": "A transfer switch’s main job is to redistribute power from a grid to a backup source of power. The control panel system of a transfer switch is what makes the unit automatic in nature. Power failures can be detected immediately with the help of automatic transfer switch (ATS) and the shift to generator power from utility power is smooth.\n\nThe control panel’s job is to detect a power failure and initiate procedures to start the new or used generator’s engine. Once the used or new generator reaches the right frequency or voltage, the control system will signal to change to generator from the normal source of power.\n\nThe Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS) is a critical piece of equipment that alternates the origin or the source of power, typically between your utility power and backup power, ensuring your system’s ability to stay online. It is inherently important in making sure that this part of your emergency system is working properly.

This inspection must consist of inspecting for signs of excessive heat, vibration damage, any level of deterioration, any leakage or contamination.</li>\n \t<li>Any accumulations of dirt or dust must be removed. Dirt, dust and any other contaminants should always be removed from the outside and inside with a vacuum cleaner, dry cloth or brush. One should not use compressed air to blow away contaminants and dirt. This can result in debris being lodged in components resulting in damage to the switch.</li>\n \t<li>If the inspection exposes damaged or loose components contact a trained professional to perform the repair work.</li>\n \t<li>Any worn, broken or missing external sections must be substituted with manufacturer’s recommended components.</li>\n \t<li>Contact the local authorized distributor or dealer for the specific part number to order.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong><u>Internal Inspection </u></strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>All power sources must be turned OFF afore any internal inspection.</li>\n \t<li>Verify to see if any external glitches found have disturbed internal components, while opening the switch door.</li>\n \t<li>A trained service technician must be called to perform any service work.

The test should verify the following:\n<ul>\n \t<li>The necessary sequence of functioning happens when the load shifts to the emergency source which results in primary source failure</li>\n \t<li>Verify indicator LEDs on the transfer switch operates properly</li>\n \t<li>Watch and eavesdrop for any unnecessary vibration or noise in the course of operation</li>\n \t<li>Finish the test once the switch transfers the load to the standby source and check the foreseen sequence of operations happening as the transfer switch shifts the load to the primary power source and signals the generator set to turn OFF later or after a cool down period.</li>\n \t<li>Check if the time delay in the OFF position works while load is transferred to the standby source and transferred back to the favored source, in the case of systems with programmed time transitions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Functional Test</strong></h3>\nThe transfer switch functional tests comprise of electrical and manual tests. A manual operator handle is provided with the transfer switch for maintenance purposes only. Before it is operated electrically, manual operation of the switch must be checked.\n\nA usual method of an automatic transfer switch functional test for a standby generator is explained below:\n<ol>\n \t<li>To begin the test, close the normal source circuit breaker. The switch controller will light up the available LED when right voltage is sensed. If the source 1 stages the automatic transfer switch mechanism, the LED at source 1 will turn on. Verify the phase to phase voltages at the utility line terminals.</li>\n \t<li>Start the engine generator after closing the alternate source breaker. The S2 (Alternate) Available LED will illuminate when correct voltage and frequency levels are sensed. Turn OFF the engine generator after both sources have been validated and place the generator's start control in the automatic position.</li>\n \t<li>Replicate a utility failure by opening the Source 1 i.e. the normal side breaker. The delay to engine start timer begins its timing cycle. After the timer has completed its timing cycle, the engine start contacts close to start the generator.</li>\n \t<li>When generator frequency and voltage touch the fixed reinstate points the Source 2 available LED lights up. Simultaneously, the delay to generator timer begins its timing cycle. When the time delay is completed the ATS will transfer to Generator, the S1 position LED goes off, and the S2 position LED illuminates. Systems shall transfer in no less than 10 seconds where failure of the equipment to perform could result in loss of human life or serious injuries.</li>\n \t<li>Reclose the Source 1 breaker to re transfer to the normal source. The delay to utility timer begins its timing cycle. When the timer has completed its timing cycle, the ATS will transfer. The S2 position LED goes off, and the S1 position LED illuminates.</li>\n \t<li>The delay engine stop timer will begin its timing cycle. The generator runs unloaded for the duration of this timing cycle. The generator will Turn OFF, once the timer finishes its timing cycle, The S2 Available LED goes off. A minimum time delay of 5 minutes should be provided for unloaded running of the EPS prior to shutdown to allow for engine cool down (NFPA 110). The minimum 5-minute delay is not required on small air-cooled prime movers 15 kW or less.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><strong>Precautions</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Inspection and Cleaning Before doing any work on the transfer switch, de-energize all sources of power.</li>\n \t<li>The switch must be checked for any moisture, dirt or dust and must be vacuumed or wiped with a soft brush or dry cloth.</li>\n \t<li>DO NOT use a blower since debris may become lodged in the electrical and mechanical components and cause damage.</li>\n \t<li>Any surface deposits must be removed with a clean cloth.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Benefits of Automatic Transfer Switch Testing</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Uninterrupted electrical supply</li>\n \t<li>Provides efficient switching to generator power</li>\n \t<li>Ensures safety</li>\n \t<li>Faster connection</li>\n</ul>",

The test should verify the following:\n<ul>\n \t<li>The necessary sequence of functioning happens when the load shifts to the emergency source which results in primary source failure</li>\n \t<li>Verify indicator LEDs on the transfer switch operates properly</li>\n \t<li>Watch and eavesdrop for any unnecessary vibration or noise in the course of operation</li>\n \t<li>Finish the test once the switch transfers the load to the standby source and check the foreseen sequence of operations happening as the transfer switch shifts the load to the primary power source and signals the generator set to turn OFF later or after a cool down period.</li>\n \t<li>Check if the time delay in the OFF position works while load is transferred to the standby source and transferred back to the favored source, in the case of systems with programmed time transitions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Functional Test</strong></h3>\nThe transfer switch functional tests comprise of electrical and manual tests. A manual operator handle is provided with the transfer switch for maintenance purposes only. Before it is operated electrically, manual operation of the switch must be checked.\n\nA usual method of an automatic transfer switch functional test for a standby generator is explained below:\n<ol>\n \t<li>To begin the test, close the normal source circuit breaker. The switch controller will light up the available LED when right voltage is sensed. If the source 1 stages the automatic transfer switch mechanism, the LED at source 1 will turn on. Verify the phase to phase voltages at the utility line terminals.</li>\n \t<li>Start the engine generator after closing the alternate source breaker. The S2 (Alternate) Available LED will illuminate when correct voltage and frequency levels are sensed. Turn OFF the engine generator after both sources have been validated and place the generator's start control in the automatic position.</li>\n \t<li>Replicate a utility failure by opening the Source 1 i.e. the normal side breaker. The delay to engine start timer begins its timing cycle. After the timer has completed its timing cycle, the engine start contacts close to start the generator.</li>\n \t<li>When generator frequency and voltage touch the fixed reinstate points the Source 2 available LED lights up. Simultaneously, the delay to generator timer begins its timing cycle. When the time delay is completed the ATS will transfer to Generator, the S1 position LED goes off, and the S2 position LED illuminates. Systems shall transfer in no less than 10 seconds where failure of the equipment to perform could result in loss of human life or serious injuries.</li>\n \t<li>Reclose the Source 1 breaker to re transfer to the normal source. The delay to utility timer begins its timing cycle. When the timer has completed its timing cycle, the ATS will transfer. The S2 position LED goes off, and the S1 position LED illuminates.</li>\n \t<li>The delay engine stop timer will begin its timing cycle. The generator runs unloaded for the duration of this timing cycle. The generator will Turn OFF, once the timer finishes its timing cycle, The S2 Available LED goes off. A minimum time delay of 5 minutes should be provided for unloaded running of the EPS prior to shutdown to allow for engine cool down (NFPA 110). The minimum 5-minute delay is not required on small air-cooled prime movers 15 kW or less.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><strong>Precautions</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Inspection and Cleaning Before doing any work on the transfer switch, de-energize all sources of power.</li>\n \t<li>The switch must be checked for any moisture, dirt or dust and must be vacuumed or wiped with a soft brush or dry cloth.</li>\n \t<li>DO NOT use a blower since debris may become lodged in the electrical and mechanical components and cause damage.</li>\n \t<li>Any surface deposits must be removed with a clean cloth.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Benefits of Automatic Transfer Switch Testing</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Uninterrupted electrical supply</li>\n \t<li>Provides efficient switching to generator power</li>\n \t<li>Ensures safety</li>\n \t<li>Faster connection</li>\n</ul>",

The amount of tension created in the bolt is critical.\n<h2><strong>What happens when you over torque?</strong></h2>\nThe process of over torqueing is one in which you are tightening a nut or bolt head and stretching the bolt.

The actual resistance of the bolt is a much higher resistance that the resistance of two sandwiched pieces of copper.\n\nWhen a bolt is torqued to spec, it firmly applies pressure to the copper, making the resistance lower. Low resistance is good when pertaining to electric. Current flows in the path of least resistance. So, if the copper connection is lower than the bolt, all current will go through the copper and not the bolt. That is the purpose.

This requirement includes verifying the given torque setting.\n<h2><strong>Benefits of Torque Testing</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Loss of energy can be prevented when connections are tight.

You may notice a skewed setscrew or damaged setscrew on a mechanical lug, which could indicate a stripped connection. When breakers are stripped, there may be no obvious visual sign.\n\nBoth loose and overly tightened connections create a risk of failure. Neither industry standards nor equipment manufacturers suggest periodic retightening of connections. Even when a “hot” connection is detected during an infrared inspection, simply tightening the connection probably will not correct the deficiency.<sup>1</sup> The connection must be disassembled, cleaned and reassembled with the proper tool and torque.

Each year thereafter, recognized companies must calibrate the equipment and apply a sticker showing the date the calibration was done.\n\nTorque values usually are present in the sides of breaker. If that value is absent, which is often the case for older equipment and breakers, default torque values can be found in the 2008 <strong>National Electrical Code Handbook</strong> (after section 110.14). In the 2011 <strong>NEC </strong>and newer codes,<sup>3, 4</sup> they can be found in Annex I. These values should never be substituted for the manufacturer’s instructions.<strong> </strong>\n<h2><strong>How is Torque Testing Performed?</strong></h2>\nA shortage of measuring and monitoring torque is a shortage of quality control. Insufficient torque can cause a screw or bolt to loosen from vibrations. Excessive torque can cause fasteners to overstretch and break. Once a torque design is found out for a joint, an ideal practice is to carry out periodic audits to make sure correct torque is being attained.\n\n<strong>There are 3 methods performed in a torque test sequence:</strong>\n\n<strong>The Movement Check</strong>\n\nIn this a wrench that has a torque meter on it is used (Generally, these can be rented or bought cheaply online). Using this technique to find out the torque in an installed fastener includes turning the fastener in a clockwise route, as you would when fastening it. The aim is to attempt to make it move a little, and then record the torque reading when this first happens. It’s vital that you don’t move the fastener too much, mainly if it’s too tight and is within its boundaries. Once the bolt is tightened, use a torque measuring equipment to mark off the workpiece and fastened bolt. Apply extra force in the tightening direction until movement is observed. Recording the reading will indicate the remaining torque applied to the joint in the beginning.\n\n<strong>The Loosening Check</strong>\n\nLoosening test also called breakaway test operates similar as the movement check except an extra force is employed to the fastened bolt in the loosening direction. At the exact position that the bolt breaks loose, note the reading and mark it off. The amount of torque necessary to loosen the bolt is the torque applied to the bolt in the beginning.\n\n<strong>The Marking Check</strong>\n\nThis method is one-sided, but it’s still valid. After fastening the bolt, mark the bolt surface of the work-piece. Then loosen the bolt. Tighten it again until the markings re-align. The torque necessary to resume the bolt to its initial position is the torque value of the bolt. One of the main plus point of utilizing this test is the fact that it is easy to do. You can utilize it for most kinds of fasteners, even Nylon screws.\n\nMost often a torque wrench is what we will use to test torque<strong>. </strong>\n\n<strong>There are few precautions that should be taken while using torque wrench</strong>:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Select a wrench that reads the desired torque at 50% to 70% of the wrench's capacity.</li>\n \t<li>Ratchet extensions do not affect the torque reading, because they do not extend the lever arm.</li>\n \t<li>Don’t employ a torque wrench that has been stored with the spring set bigger than ten percent of capacity.</li>\n \t<li>Always \"exercise\" a torque wrench through its full range of settings before using it.</li>\n \t<li>Always apply smooth, steady pressure to a torque wrench-do not jerk it.</li>\n \t<li>When a torque wrench breaks continuing to twist can break the wrench and even cause injury. Thus, stop rotating immediately.</li>\n \t<li>Do not use a torque wrench for more than an hour without setting it to zero.</li>\n \t<li>Always store a torque wrench with the spring set at zero.</li>\n \t<li>Don't use ia torque wrench in the place of a regular wrench when you don't need to test torque.</li>\n \t<li>Always follow the instructions that come with the torque wrench.</li>\n \t<li>Know the location of a qualified service center to calibrate and lubricate your wrench.</li>\n</ul>\nPerforming a quality torque testing routine creates a secure domain through exactness and precision. Measuring torque is essential for companies to ensure their product’s quality, safety and reliability isn’t compromised. The failure of a three-cent fastener that isn’t properly tightened can lead to catastrophic or latent failures. Bolts that are not tightened sufficiently can vibrate and extreme torque can strip threaded bolts and nuts.",

Once the bolt is tightened, use a torque measuring equipment to mark off the workpiece and fastened bolt. Apply extra force in the tightening direction until movement is observed. Recording the reading will indicate the remaining torque applied to the joint in the beginning.\n\n<strong>The Loosening Check</strong>\n\nLoosening test also called breakaway test operates similar as the movement check except an extra force is employed to the fastened bolt in the loosening direction. At the exact position that the bolt breaks loose, note the reading and mark it off. The amount of torque necessary to loosen the bolt is the torque applied to the bolt in the beginning.\n\n<strong>The Marking Check</strong>\n\nThis method is one-sided, but it’s still valid. After fastening the bolt, mark the bolt surface of the work-piece. Then loosen the bolt. Tighten it again until the markings re-align. The torque necessary to resume the bolt to its initial position is the torque value of the bolt. One of the main plus point of utilizing this test is the fact that it is easy to do. You can utilize it for most kinds of fasteners, even Nylon screws.\n\nMost often a torque wrench is what we will use to test torque<strong>. </strong>\n\n<strong>There are few precautions that should be taken while using torque wrench</strong>:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Select a wrench that reads the desired torque at 50% to 70% of the wrench's capacity.</li>\n \t<li>Ratchet extensions do not affect the torque reading, because they do not extend the lever arm.</li>\n \t<li>Don’t employ a torque wrench that has been stored with the spring set bigger than ten percent of capacity.</li>\n \t<li>Always \"exercise\" a torque wrench through its full range of settings before using it.</li>\n \t<li>Always apply smooth, steady pressure to a torque wrench-do not jerk it.</li>\n \t<li>When a torque wrench breaks continuing to twist can break the wrench and even cause injury. Thus, stop rotating immediately.</li>\n \t<li>Do not use a torque wrench for more than an hour without setting it to zero.</li>\n \t<li>Always store a torque wrench with the spring set at zero.</li>\n \t<li>Don't use ia torque wrench in the place of a regular wrench when you don't need to test torque.</li>\n \t<li>Always follow the instructions that come with the torque wrench.</li>\n \t<li>Know the location of a qualified service center to calibrate and lubricate your wrench.</li>\n</ul>\nPerforming a quality torque testing routine creates a secure domain through exactness and precision. Measuring torque is essential for companies to ensure their product’s quality, safety and reliability isn’t compromised. The failure of a three-cent fastener that isn’t properly tightened can lead to catastrophic or latent failures. Bolts that are not tightened sufficiently can vibrate and extreme torque can strip threaded bolts and nuts.",

        "content": "Capacitor Bank is a combination of numerous capacitors of similar rating that are joined in parallel or series with one another to collect electrical energy. The resulting bank is then used to counteract or correct a power factor lag or phase shift in an AC power supply. They can also be utilized in a DC power supply to step up the total amount of stored energy or to step up the ripple current capacity of the power supply.\n\n<strong>Capacitor banks are generally used to</strong><strong> </strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Power Factor Correction</li>\n \t<li>Reactive Power Compensation</li>\n</ul>\nCapacitors have the opposite effect to the inductive motors where it cancels out a large current flow and thereby, this capacitor bank reduces your electricity bill.<strong> </strong>\n<h2><strong>Why is Capacitor Bank Testing Done?</strong></h2>\nCapacitors banks are an important aspect of your power system that provides correct power factor correction. Power Factor Correction unit have various functioning settings depending upon on the position they are installed. Moisture, time, harmonics and temperature changes the power factor correction of capacitor banks. Already installed capacitor banks, if not tested or unmaintained within specific time, becomes incapable of functioning at their finest levels. With time, the operation of capacitors can weaken, decreasing the power factor of your power system, resulting in power factor loss.\n<h2>What are Done During Capacitor Bank Testing?</h2>\nFor checking a capacitor bank, IEEE or ANSI standard is utilized. There are 3 types of test done on capacitor banks. They are\n<ul>\n \t<li>Design Tests or Type Tests</li>\n \t<li>Production Test or Routine Tests</li>\n \t<li>Field Tests or Pre-commissioning Tests</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Design Tests or Type Tests of Capacitor Bank</strong></h2>\nWhen a new design of power capacitor is launched by a manufacturer, it to be tested whether the new batch of capacitor comply the standard or not. Type tests or Design tests aren’t done on single capacitor instead they are done on some casually chosen capacitors to make sure accordance of the standard.\n\nDuring launching of new design, once these design tests are performed, there is no need of repeating these tests for any further batch of production until the design is changed. Design tests or type tests are usually expensive or destructive.\n\n<strong>The type tests Performed on Capacitor Bank are -</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>High Voltage Impulse Withstand Test.</li>\n \t<li>Bushing Test.</li>\n \t<li>Thermal Stability Test.</li>\n \t<li>Radio Influence Voltage (RIV) Test.</li>\n \t<li>Voltage Decay Test.</li>\n \t<li>Short Circuit Discharge Test.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Routine Test of Capacitor Bank</strong></h2>\nRoutine test is also referred as production tests. These tests should be performed on each capacitor unit of a production batch to ensure performance parameter of individual.\n<h3><strong>Short Time Over Voltage Test</strong></h3>\nIn this test, a direct voltage of 4.3 times of rated rms voltage or alternating voltage of 2 times of rated rms voltage is applied to the bushing stands of capacitor unit. The capacitor range must withstand any of these voltages for at least ten seconds. The temperature of the unit during test should be maintained at 25 ± 5 Degree. In case of three phase capacitor unit, if the three phase capacitor elements are connected in star with neutral connected through a fourth bushing or through casing, the voltage applied between phase terminals, would be √3 times of above mentioned voltages. Same voltage as above would be applied across phase terminal and neutral terminal.\n<h3><strong>Terminal to Case Voltage Test</strong></h3>\nThis test is only applicable where internal capacitor elements of a unit are isolated from its casing. This makes sure the withstand capacity of over voltage of the insulation offered between capacitor elements and metal casing. The test voltage is applied between casing and bushing stand for 10 seconds. For the capacitor unit having bushings of different BIL, this test is done based on lower BIL bushing.\n<h3><strong>Capacitance Test</strong></h3>\nThis test is done to ensure that each of the capacitor unit in a batch or lot should give not more than 110 % of its rated VAR during normal functioning within possible temperature limit which is considered as ˚C. If the measurement is done at any temperature other than 25˚C, then the meandered result should be calculated according to 25˚C.\n<h3><strong>Leakage Test of Capacitor Units</strong></h3>\nThis test is done to ensure that the limit is free from any leakage. In this test the test unit is heated by an external oven, to force the insulating liquid to come out from the casing if there is any leakage point. This test makes sure that all joints are tightened and sealed correctly.\n<h3><strong>Discharge Resistor Test</strong></h3>\nThis test is done on each capacitor unit to ensure that internal discharge device or resistor is capable enough to discharge the capacitor unit from its initial residual voltage to 50 V or less with in specified time limit. Initial residual voltage may be √2 times of rated rms voltage of the capacitor.\n<h3><strong>Loss Determination Test</strong></h3>\nThis test is performed on each capacitor unit to demonstrate, the loss occurs in the unit during operation is less than the maximum allowable loss of the unit.\n<h3><strong>Fuse Capability Test of Internal Fused Capacitor Unit</strong></h3>\nIn this test the capacitor unit is first charged with direct voltage (DC) up to 1.7 times of the rated rms voltage of the capacitor unit. Then this unit can discharge through a gap situated as closely as possible without any additional impedance to the discharge circuit. The capacitance of capacitor should be measured before application of charging voltage and after discharging the unit. The variance of these 2 measurements should be smaller than the variance of capacitance when an internal fuse element is activated.\n<h2><strong>Pre-commissioning or Installation Test of Capacitor Bank</strong></h2>\nWhen a capacitor bank is practically installed at site, there must be some specific tests to be performed to ensure the connection of each unit and the bank are in order and as per specifications.\n<h3><strong>Capacitance Measurement</strong></h3>\nTo determine the capacitance of the bank as whole, a sensitive capacitance meter is used, to make sure the connection of the bank is as per requirement. If the measured value is not as calculated, there must be some wrong connection in the bank which to be rectified. We should apply full rated voltage for determining capacitance of a bank, instead of that only ten percent of rated voltage to find out the capacitance of the unit. The formula of capacitance is Where, V is the applied voltage to the bank, I is the supply current and ω = 377.7 which is a constant quality.\n<h3><strong>High Voltage Insulation Test</strong></h3>\nThis test is done according to NBMA CP-1.\n<h2>How is Capacitor Bank Testing Done?</h2>\n<h3><strong>Carry Out an On-Site Risk Assessment </strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Before doing this task any threats at the site should be assessed and identified with proper control measures.</li>\n \t<li>If any hazards cannot be decreased or managed to a suitable limit, don’t continue with the task and ask for assistance from your Supervisor.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>All Work to be Done with Capacitor Bank De-energized </strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>All the tests should be carried out with the capacitor bank de-energized and appropriate control measures in place to prevent inadvertent contact with adjacent live plant or breaching exclusion zones.</li>\n \t<li>Issue a Test Permit and follow the requirements of P53 Operate the Network Process. According to Substation Primary Plant and Secondary Systems Field Testing, safety risks applicable to capacitors include:</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n \t<li>Contact with high voltage at capacitor bank primary connections</li>\n \t<li>Extreme fault current</li>\n \t<li>Stored energy in charged capacitors</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><strong>Carry Out Secondary Isolation </strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Assess the necessities to perform secondary isolation of the protection systems.</li>\n \t<li>Consideration should be granted to the sensitivity of capacitor bank protection while making this evaluation and the potential for a capacitor under test to inadvertently discharge stored energy into a protection system.</li>\n \t<li>For majority of cases secondary isolation of the protection system would be necessary.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Record Plant Details</strong></h3>\n<strong>Record identification details of each capacitor unit</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Manufacturer’s name</li>\n \t<li>Manufacturer’s type description</li>\n \t<li>Manufacturer’s serial number</li>\n \t<li>Year of Manufacture</li>\n \t<li>Measured capacitance and rated Capacitance Cn as marked on the nameplate</li>\n \t<li>Serial number of each capacitor can</li>\n \t<li>Rated Output Qn</li>\n \t<li>Rated Voltage Un</li>\n \t<li>Rated Current In</li>\n \t<li>Temperature Category</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Visual Inspection of Capacitor Bank Condition </strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Inspect the external surfaces and ensure the capacitor units and reactors are clean and dry.</li>\n \t<li>Check that primary connections are correct.</li>\n \t<li>Check earthing to capacitor bank mounting frames and enclosure.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Measure Insulation Resistance </strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Insulation resistance tests as listed below are to be applied for one-minute duration each.</li>\n \t<li>Safety CTs/VTs attached to the bank star point must be detached for these tests.</li>\n \t<li>Where several components are connected in parallel, for example capacitor cans, it is not necessary to obtain a separate insulation resistance measurement of each component.</li>\n \t<li>To make sure that capacitors being assessed have altered adequately to allocate precise IR measurement make sure that the capacitor has been charged by the megger such that there is less than a 5 % change in IR over a 1-minute period.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Measure Capacitance </strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Measure the capacitance of each individual capacitor unit using a capacitance bridge. The use of any test equipment is to be performed in accordance with the operating instructions specific to the equipment being used.</li>\n \t<li>Note that tong type capacitance bridges can normally be used without disconnecting the capacitor units from the bank.</li>\n \t<li>It is favored not to dettach the capacitor units for measurement to evade unintended harm to the capacitor unit bushings.</li>\n \t<li>Note that the bushings have strictly specified maximum torque limits which must not be exceeded during tightening of connections.</li>\n \t<li>On the other hand, an AC current source must be attached to insert into a capacitor unit in series.</li>\n \t<li>The voltage measured across each unit from which the capacitance can be calculated according to the formula:\n<strong>C = I / (2 x Pi x f x V)\n</strong>Where C = capacitance in farads.

Un = capacitor rated voltage.</li>\n \t<li>The capacitor shall also withstand a 1-minute power frequency withstand test of a test voltage applied between the capacitor terminals and earth.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Check Balancing of Each Bank </strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Perform checking of the balance of every bank by inserting the measured capacitance amount into a proper balancing program.</li>\n \t<li>Where necessary swap cans to achieve acceptable balancing of the bank.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Carry Out Primary Injection </strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Primary injection might be performed to verify functioning bank unit protection schemes by bridging out the bank capacitor cans and using a low voltage current source to inject through appropriate CTs.</li>\n \t<li>If primary injection is required to confirm that the capacitor bank balance is correct, it should be carried out at a time when the temperature is relatively stable and uniform across the bank.</li>\n \t<li>Employ a balanced three phase source into the input terminals of the bank and determine:\n<ul>\n \t<li>The voltage applied to each phase (phase to phase and phase to neutral).</li>\n \t<li>Each phase line current.</li>\n \t<li>The voltage of the capacitor bank star points relative to neutral.</li>\n \t<li>The voltage/current measured at the out of balance protection.</li>\n \t<li>The secondary current from each metering/protection CT core.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n \t<li>Confirm that any out of balance current/voltage, when scaled from the primary injection test voltage to actual rated voltage, is below the threshold required for an out of balance alarm or trip to occur.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Complete Pre-commissioning Checklist </strong></h3>\nA capacitor bank being placed in service for the first time requires that the following items are checked (if applicable) prior to energization:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Check sheet metal work is free from transport damage and assembled correctly.</li>\n \t<li>Check that all permanently fixed panels are properly bolted in position.</li>\n \t<li>Check all door fittings are tight.</li>\n \t<li>Check door locks operate properly.</li>\n \t<li>Check overall appearance and paintwork is clean and free from scratch marks.</li>\n \t<li>Check all control cable terminations are correct and tight.</li>\n \t<li>Check capacitors are neat and free from breaks or leaks.</li>\n \t<li>Check that busbar connections have been torqued correctly.</li>\n \t<li>Check that capacitor bushing connections have been torqued correctly.</li>\n \t<li>Check earth switch operation.</li>\n \t<li>Check isolator operation.</li>\n \t<li>Check operation of discharge timers and electrical interlocking with control systems and HV circuit breakers and switches capable of energizing the bank.</li>\n \t<li>Check operation of point on wave relays, including adaptive capability of the POW relays.</li>\n \t<li>Ensure interlock system keys are provided.</li>\n \t<li>Check cubicle lighting operation.</li>\n \t<li>Check the heater operation.</li>\n \t<li>Check all fuses/links are in place.</li>\n \t<li>Check all CT secondary links are closed.</li>\n \t<li>Check external fences and gates.</li>\n \t<li>Check that all labels and nameplates are in position.</li>\n \t<li>Record asset management plant details for SAP/MIMS.</li>\n \t<li>Check operation of all control and protection functions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Energize and Carry Out on Load Tests </strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>After energization save secondary currents and voltages on all protection and metering secondary circuits, including residual, phase and out of balance measurements.</li>\n \t<li>Prove and record correct operation and adaptivity of point on wave switching devices.

These tests should be performed on each capacitor unit of a production batch to ensure performance parameter of individual.\n<h3><strong>Short Time Over Voltage Test</strong></h3>\nIn this test, a direct voltage of 4.3 times of rated rms voltage or alternating voltage of 2 times of rated rms voltage is applied to the bushing stands of capacitor unit. The capacitor range must withstand any of these voltages for at least ten seconds. The temperature of the unit during test should be maintained at 25 ± 5 Degree. In case of three phase capacitor unit, if the three phase capacitor elements are connected in star with neutral connected through a fourth bushing or through casing, the voltage applied between phase terminals, would be √3 times of above mentioned voltages. Same voltage as above would be applied across phase terminal and neutral terminal.\n<h3><strong>Terminal to Case Voltage Test</strong></h3>\nThis test is only applicable where internal capacitor elements of a unit are isolated from its casing. This makes sure the withstand capacity of over voltage of the insulation offered between capacitor elements and metal casing. The test voltage is applied between casing and bushing stand for 10 seconds. For the capacitor unit having bushings of different BIL, this test is done based on lower BIL bushing.\n<h3><strong>Capacitance Test</strong></h3>\nThis test is done to ensure that each of the capacitor unit in a batch or lot should give not more than 110 % of its rated VAR during normal functioning within possible temperature limit which is considered as ˚C. If the measurement is done at any temperature other than 25˚C, then the meandered result should be calculated according to 25˚C.\n<h3><strong>Leakage Test of Capacitor Units</strong></h3>\nThis test is done to ensure that the limit is free from any leakage. In this test the test unit is heated by an external oven, to force the insulating liquid to come out from the casing if there is any leakage point. This test makes sure that all joints are tightened and sealed correctly.\n<h3><strong>Discharge Resistor Test</strong></h3>\nThis test is done on each capacitor unit to ensure that internal discharge device or resistor is capable enough to discharge the capacitor unit from its initial residual voltage to 50 V or less with in specified time limit. Initial residual voltage may be √2 times of rated rms voltage of the capacitor.\n<h3><strong>Loss Determination Test</strong></h3>\nThis test is performed on each capacitor unit to demonstrate, the loss occurs in the unit during operation is less than the maximum allowable loss of the unit.\n<h3><strong>Fuse Capability Test of Internal Fused Capacitor Unit</strong></h3>\nIn this test the capacitor unit is first charged with direct voltage (DC) up to 1.7 times of the rated rms voltage of the capacitor unit. Then this unit can discharge through a gap situated as closely as possible without any additional impedance to the discharge circuit. The capacitance of capacitor should be measured before application of charging voltage and after discharging the unit. The variance of these 2 measurements should be smaller than the variance of capacitance when an internal fuse element is activated.\n<h2><strong>Pre-commissioning or Installation Test of Capacitor Bank</strong></h2>\nWhen a capacitor bank is practically installed at site, there must be some specific tests to be performed to ensure the connection of each unit and the bank are in order and as per specifications.\n<h3><strong>Capacitance Measurement</strong></h3>\nTo determine the capacitance of the bank as whole, a sensitive capacitance meter is used, to make sure the connection of the bank is as per requirement. If the measured value is not as calculated, there must be some wrong connection in the bank which to be rectified. We should apply full rated voltage for determining capacitance of a bank, instead of that only ten percent of rated voltage to find out the capacitance of the unit. The formula of capacitance is Where, V is the applied voltage to the bank, I is the supply current and ω = 377.7 which is a constant quality.\n<h3><strong>High Voltage Insulation Test</strong></h3>\nThis test is done according to NBMA CP-1.\n<h2>How is Capacitor Bank Testing Done?</h2>\n<h3><strong>Carry Out an On-Site Risk Assessment </strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Before doing this task any threats at the site should be assessed and identified with proper control measures.</li>\n \t<li>If any hazards cannot be decreased or managed to a suitable limit, don’t continue with the task and ask for assistance from your Supervisor.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>All Work to be Done with Capacitor Bank De-energized </strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>All the tests should be carried out with the capacitor bank de-energized and appropriate control measures in place to prevent inadvertent contact with adjacent live plant or breaching exclusion zones.</li>\n \t<li>Issue a Test Permit and follow the requirements of P53 Operate the Network Process. According to Substation Primary Plant and Secondary Systems Field Testing, safety risks applicable to capacitors include:</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n \t<li>Contact with high voltage at capacitor bank primary connections</li>\n \t<li>Extreme fault current</li>\n \t<li>Stored energy in charged capacitors</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><strong>Carry Out Secondary Isolation </strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Assess the necessities to perform secondary isolation of the protection systems.</li>\n \t<li>Consideration should be granted to the sensitivity of capacitor bank protection while making this evaluation and the potential for a capacitor under test to inadvertently discharge stored energy into a protection system.</li>\n \t<li>For majority of cases secondary isolation of the protection system would be necessary.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Record Plant Details</strong></h3>\n<strong>Record identification details of each capacitor unit</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Manufacturer’s name</li>\n \t<li>Manufacturer’s type description</li>\n \t<li>Manufacturer’s serial number</li>\n \t<li>Year of Manufacture</li>\n \t<li>Measured capacitance and rated Capacitance Cn as marked on the nameplate</li>\n \t<li>Serial number of each capacitor can</li>\n \t<li>Rated Output Qn</li>\n \t<li>Rated Voltage Un</li>\n \t<li>Rated Current In</li>\n \t<li>Temperature Category</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Visual Inspection of Capacitor Bank Condition </strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Inspect the external surfaces and ensure the capacitor units and reactors are clean and dry.</li>\n \t<li>Check that primary connections are correct.</li>\n \t<li>Check earthing to capacitor bank mounting frames and enclosure.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Measure Insulation Resistance </strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Insulation resistance tests as listed below are to be applied for one-minute duration each.</li>\n \t<li>Safety CTs/VTs attached to the bank star point must be detached for these tests.</li>\n \t<li>Where several components are connected in parallel, for example capacitor cans, it is not necessary to obtain a separate insulation resistance measurement of each component.</li>\n \t<li>To make sure that capacitors being assessed have altered adequately to allocate precise IR measurement make sure that the capacitor has been charged by the megger such that there is less than a 5 % change in IR over a 1-minute period.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Measure Capacitance </strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Measure the capacitance of each individual capacitor unit using a capacitance bridge.

        "description": "Cable testing is done to predict faults and then deal with it. Cable testing a vital concern for all those involved with the distribution of electricity.",
        "content": "Cabling is an expensive business and must be treated carefully. The expenditure of substitution once the routes are all concealed is bigger. The fault is not always visible like crushing, bending or kinking. Make sure that your cabling installer have made provision to protect installed cabling from other worker’s actions. This is substantially less costly than changing cabling in the future. If cable routes are guarded with no way of opening them between termination and installation, it is ideal to terminate the cables for the time being, so they can be tested before the routes are protected.\n<h2><strong>Why is Cable Testing Needed?</strong></h2>\n<strong>Cable testing is made to drop down testing times. This is done to check the:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Cable conformity</li>\n \t<li>Cabling quality</li>\n \t<li>Cable functionality</li>\n</ul>\nMany times, a fault in a cable can be seen well before it becomes an actual problem. A visual inspection of all the cables in your facility is a great way to find trouble before it causes you a downtime. We look for corrosion on the copper, cracks in the insulation, moisture on the cables and many other indicators of damage to the cables.\n\nCable faults cost money and create disruption, so there is an enormous demand for cable test techniques to ensure cables and joints are in good condition, and to allow cable faults to be located rapidly.\n\nCable testing to both predict and then deal with faults is a vital concern for all those involved with the distribution of electricity. A wide range of test techniques and test equipment are available to allow this concern to be effectively addressed, but cable testing can, nevertheless, be a challenging task.\n\nFor this reason, a resource that’s as important as the test equipment itself is access to expertise that will help with selecting the best equipment for the job, and using it in such a way that it delivers the best results\n<h2><strong>What is Done During Cable Testing?</strong></h2>\nGiven below are the tests and inspections that must be <strong>done before energizing</strong> low voltage cable rated 600V or below.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Compare cable data with drawings and specifications. Pay attention to the number of sets, the cable size, routing, and insulation ratings. Note these items on the test sheet.</li>\n \t<li>Check uncovered parts of cable for material damage. Look at the condition of the cable jacket and insulation of exposed sections. Verify that the connection points match what is shown on the project single-line diagram.</li>\n \t<li>Check bolted electrical connections for high resistance with the use of a calibrated torque-wrench, low-resistance ohmmeter or thermographic survey.\n<ul>\n \t<li>When using a calibrated torque wrench, reference ANSI/NETA Table 100.12 US Standard Fasteners, Bolt Torque Values for Electrical Connections.</li>\n \t<li>The values of similar bolted connections must be compared and check which value shift by more than fifty percent of the smallest value in the case where a low resistance ohmmeter is utilized.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n \t<li>Look at the condition of the exposed cable jacket and insulation when performing a visual inspection on low voltage wire and cable.</li>\n \t<li>Inspect compression-applied connections by verifying that the connector is properly rated for the installed cable size and has the proper indentations.</li>\n \t<li>Perform an insulation-resistance test on each conductor with respect to ground and adjacent conductors. Test period must be for 1 minute using a voltage according to manufacturer’s published data.</li>\n \t<li>If no literature from the manufacturer is available, apply 500 volts dc for 300-volt rated cable and 1000 volts dc for 600-volt rated cable. Insulation-resistance values must be according to the manufacturer's published data. If no data from the manufacturer exists, the values should be no less than 100 megohms. Perform continuity tests to ensure correct cable connection and phasing.</li>\n \t<li>Verify uniform resistance of parallel conductors using a low-resistance ohmmeter. Measure the resistance of each cable individually and investigate deviations in resistance between parallel conductors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Given below are various kinds of tests that are conducted on cables:</h3>\n<strong>The following tests are type test of electrical power cable.</strong>\n<ol>\n \t<li>Persulphate test (for copper)</li>\n \t<li>Annealing test (for copper)</li>\n \t<li>Tensile test (for Aluminium)</li>\n \t<li>Wrapping test (for Aluminium)</li>\n \t<li>Conductor resistance test (for all)</li>\n \t<li>Test for thickness of insulation (for all)</li>\n \t<li>Measurement of overall diameter (where specified) (for all)</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><strong>Physical tests for Insulation and Sheath</strong></h3>\n<ol>\n \t<li>Tensile strength and elongation at break</li>\n \t<li>Ageing in air oven</li>\n \t<li>Ageing in air bomb</li>\n \t<li>Ageing in oxygen bomb</li>\n \t<li>Hot set</li>\n \t<li>Oil resistance</li>\n \t<li>Tear resistance</li>\n \t<li>Insulation resistance</li>\n \t<li>High voltage (water immersion) test</li>\n \t<li>Flammability test (only for SE-3, SE-4)</li>\n \t<li>Water abortion test (for insulation)</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><strong>Acceptance test:</strong> The following shall constitute acceptance test:</h3>\n<ol>\n \t<li>Annealing test (for copper)</li>\n \t<li>Tensile test (for Aluminium)</li>\n \t<li>Wrapping test (for Aluminium)</li>\n \t<li>Conductor resistance test</li>\n \t<li>Test for thickness of insulation and sheath and overall diameter</li>\n \t<li>Tensile strength and Elongation at break of insulation and heath</li>\n \t<li>Hot set test for insulation and sheath</li>\n \t<li>High voltage test</li>\n \t<li>Insulation resistance test</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><strong>Routine test</strong>: The following shall constitute the routine test.</h3>\n<ol>\n \t<li>Conductor resistance test</li>\n \t<li>High voltage test</li>\n \t<li>Insulation resistance test</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><strong>How is Cable Testing Performed?</strong></h2>\n<strong>Given below are the tests done while cable testing is done:</strong>\n<h3><strong>Continuity Test</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>The continuity test (also called low resistance measurement) is measuring the low resistance of cables, from 1 mΩ to 250 Ω.</li>\n \t<li>The continuity test can be made in 2 or 4 wires according to the resistance to be measured: 2 wires for resistances &gt; 1 Ω, and 4 wires for resistances &lt; 1 Ω.</li>\n \t<li>The continuity test in 2 wires mode consists in injecting a programmable current and measuring voltage and current at the terminals of the resistance to be tested. Ohm's law will give the exact value.</li>\n \t<li>In four wires mode or Kelvin method continuity test divide the switching matrix into 2 internal buses</li>\n \t<li>directing the test current</li>\n \t<li>conveying the voltage of the terminals of the element under measurement.</li>\n</ul>\nEven-addressed points are allocated to the SENSE of the measurement, odd points to injection of the current. This layout is doable all the way through the switching matrix and can be joint with two wire continuity tests.\n<ul>\n \t<li>To give you an example, the continuity test in 4 wires mode lets you carry out measurements on wires of 50 cm length and 5/10 mm cross-section (between 7 and 13 mW) with good resolution.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Insulation Test:</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>The insulation test also known as high resistance test is always made DC. The insulation test is combined with a short-circuit test and high voltage test in DC.</li>\n \t<li>The insulation test combines several functions.</li>\n \t<li>The insulation test can perform:\n<ul>\n \t<li>determining insulation resistances from fifty kilo ohm to two thousand mega ohm at high voltage i.e. from 20V to 2000V.</li>\n \t<li>measurement of dielectric strength and detection of short circuits.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n \t<li>The insulation test proceeds as follows:\n<ul>\n \t<li>An initial test at low voltage (continuity measurement) to detect any short circuit (1). If a short circuit is found, the insulation test stops (the message SHORT CIRCUIT appears in the error list).</li>\n \t<li>If there is no short circuit, the high voltage is applied. During the programmable rise time (2), if breakdown occurs, the voltage is displayed and the test stops (the breakdown voltage is given in the error list).</li>\n \t<li>If no breakdown occurs and if the voltage does not reach the required value (±10%), the message U&lt;Uprog appears in the error list.</li>\n \t<li>Next, the voltage is applied for the duration of the programmed application time (3). If breakdown occurs during this period, the moment when the fault appears is displayed in the error list and the test stops.</li>\n \t<li>Lastly, if all goes well, at the end of the application time (4), the insulation test is made, and the insulation resistance measured. The tester will add a measurement time as a function of the range requested. The measurement time varies from 20ms to 240ms according to range.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n \t<li>To end the sequence, the tester reduces the high voltage and then discharges the unit tested to an earth resistance (total time 20ms).</li>\n \t<li>This procedure is identical at the end of every measurement of insulation.</li>\n \t<li>The dielectric strength test detects any sudden variation in the increase of the test current outside the programmed limit.</li>\n \t<li>The short circuit test or high voltage test can be programmed out of the test.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Phasing Test:</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>The correct phasing of all LV circuits shall be checked at all positions where the LV cables are terminated into fuse bases and where any LV cable is run from point to point.</li>\n \t<li>This test shall be performed with an instrument designed for the purpose. Mains frequency voltage of 240 Volts is not acceptable for this test.</li>\n \t<li>The neutral conductor shall be connected to the earth stake for this test.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Earth Resistance Test:</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>In any overhead or underground network, the earth resistance at any point along the length of a LV feeder is to have a maximum resistance of 10 ohms prior to connection to the existing network.</li>\n \t<li>In any overhead or underground network, the overall resistance to earth Shall be less than 1 ohm prior to connection to the existing network.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>High Voltage Test:</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>The high voltage test (also called dielectric strength test or hipot test) can be made in AC or DC. If the high voltage test is made in DC, it is then combined with insulation; if the high voltage test is made in AC, it is then, this is then, more stressful for the sample and made according to the sketch below.</li>\n \t<li>Measurement of high voltage test under alternating current is performed using an alternating voltage (50Hz) adjustable to an effective 50V to 1,500V. As is the case with direct current, the high voltage test detects any sudden rise of current up to a programmed threshold.</li>\n \t<li>The short circuit test is maintained by default. The rise time is more than 500 ms and the application time at least one period.</li>\n \t<li>Warning: The high voltage test under alternating current is penalized by the capacitive value of the tested equipment. It must be remembered that the generator power is limited to 5 mA.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Benefits of Cable Testing</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Product warranties are limited</li>\n \t<li>Testing is less expensive than repair</li>\n \t<li>Periodic testing will futureproof the infrastructure</li>\n</ul>",

        "content": "Cabling is an expensive business and must be treated carefully. The expenditure of substitution once the routes are all concealed is bigger. The fault is not always visible like crushing, bending or kinking. Make sure that your cabling installer have made provision to protect installed cabling from other worker’s actions. This is substantially less costly than changing cabling in the future. If cable routes are guarded with no way of opening them between termination and installation, it is ideal to terminate the cables for the time being, so they can be tested before the routes are protected.\n<h2><strong>Why is Cable Testing Needed?</strong></h2>\n<strong>Cable testing is made to drop down testing times. This is done to check the:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Cable conformity</li>\n \t<li>Cabling quality</li>\n \t<li>Cable functionality</li>\n</ul>\nMany times, a fault in a cable can be seen well before it becomes an actual problem. A visual inspection of all the cables in your facility is a great way to find trouble before it causes you a downtime. We look for corrosion on the copper, cracks in the insulation, moisture on the cables and many other indicators of damage to the cables.\n\nCable faults cost money and create disruption, so there is an enormous demand for cable test techniques to ensure cables and joints are in good condition, and to allow cable faults to be located rapidly.\n\nCable testing to both predict and then deal with faults is a vital concern for all those involved with the distribution of electricity. A wide range of test techniques and test equipment are available to allow this concern to be effectively addressed, but cable testing can, nevertheless, be a challenging task.\n\nFor this reason, a resource that’s as important as the test equipment itself is access to expertise that will help with selecting the best equipment for the job, and using it in such a way that it delivers the best results\n<h2><strong>What is Done During Cable Testing?</strong></h2>\nGiven below are the tests and inspections that must be <strong>done before energizing</strong> low voltage cable rated 600V or below.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Compare cable data with drawings and specifications. Pay attention to the number of sets, the cable size, routing, and insulation ratings. Note these items on the test sheet.</li>\n \t<li>Check uncovered parts of cable for material damage. Look at the condition of the cable jacket and insulation of exposed sections. Verify that the connection points match what is shown on the project single-line diagram.</li>\n \t<li>Check bolted electrical connections for high resistance with the use of a calibrated torque-wrench, low-resistance ohmmeter or thermographic survey.\n<ul>\n \t<li>When using a calibrated torque wrench, reference ANSI/NETA Table 100.12 US Standard Fasteners, Bolt Torque Values for Electrical Connections.</li>\n \t<li>The values of similar bolted connections must be compared and check which value shift by more than fifty percent of the smallest value in the case where a low resistance ohmmeter is utilized.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n \t<li>Look at the condition of the exposed cable jacket and insulation when performing a visual inspection on low voltage wire and cable.</li>\n \t<li>Inspect compression-applied connections by verifying that the connector is properly rated for the installed cable size and has the proper indentations.</li>\n \t<li>Perform an insulation-resistance test on each conductor with respect to ground and adjacent conductors. Test period must be for 1 minute using a voltage according to manufacturer’s published data.</li>\n \t<li>If no literature from the manufacturer is available, apply 500 volts dc for 300-volt rated cable and 1000 volts dc for 600-volt rated cable. Insulation-resistance values must be according to the manufacturer's published data. If no data from the manufacturer exists, the values should be no less than 100 megohms. Perform continuity tests to ensure correct cable connection and phasing.</li>\n \t<li>Verify uniform resistance of parallel conductors using a low-resistance ohmmeter. Measure the resistance of each cable individually and investigate deviations in resistance between parallel conductors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Given below are various kinds of tests that are conducted on cables:</h3>\n<strong>The following tests are type test of electrical power cable.</strong>\n<ol>\n \t<li>Persulphate test (for copper)</li>\n \t<li>Annealing test (for copper)</li>\n \t<li>Tensile test (for Aluminium)</li>\n \t<li>Wrapping test (for Aluminium)</li>\n \t<li>Conductor resistance test (for all)</li>\n \t<li>Test for thickness of insulation (for all)</li>\n \t<li>Measurement of overall diameter (where specified) (for all)</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><strong>Physical tests for Insulation and Sheath</strong></h3>\n<ol>\n \t<li>Tensile strength and elongation at break</li>\n \t<li>Ageing in air oven</li>\n \t<li>Ageing in air bomb</li>\n \t<li>Ageing in oxygen bomb</li>\n \t<li>Hot set</li>\n \t<li>Oil resistance</li>\n \t<li>Tear resistance</li>\n \t<li>Insulation resistance</li>\n \t<li>High voltage (water immersion) test</li>\n \t<li>Flammability test (only for SE-3, SE-4)</li>\n \t<li>Water abortion test (for insulation)</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><strong>Acceptance test:</strong> The following shall constitute acceptance test:</h3>\n<ol>\n \t<li>Annealing test (for copper)</li>\n \t<li>Tensile test (for Aluminium)</li>\n \t<li>Wrapping test (for Aluminium)</li>\n \t<li>Conductor resistance test</li>\n \t<li>Test for thickness of insulation and sheath and overall diameter</li>\n \t<li>Tensile strength and Elongation at break of insulation and heath</li>\n \t<li>Hot set test for insulation and sheath</li>\n \t<li>High voltage test</li>\n \t<li>Insulation resistance test</li>\n</ol>\n<h3><strong>Routine test</strong>: The following shall constitute the routine test.</h3>\n<ol>\n \t<li>Conductor resistance test</li>\n \t<li>High voltage test</li>\n \t<li>Insulation resistance test</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><strong>How is Cable Testing Performed?</strong></h2>\n<strong>Given below are the tests done while cable testing is done:</strong>\n<h3><strong>Continuity Test</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>The continuity test (also called low resistance measurement) is measuring the low resistance of cables, from 1 mΩ to 250 Ω.</li>\n \t<li>The continuity test can be made in 2 or 4 wires according to the resistance to be measured: 2 wires for resistances &gt; 1 Ω, and 4 wires for resistances &lt; 1 Ω.</li>\n \t<li>The continuity test in 2 wires mode consists in injecting a programmable current and measuring voltage and current at the terminals of the resistance to be tested. Ohm's law will give the exact value.</li>\n \t<li>In four wires mode or Kelvin method continuity test divide the switching matrix into 2 internal buses</li>\n \t<li>directing the test current</li>\n \t<li>conveying the voltage of the terminals of the element under measurement.</li>\n</ul>\nEven-addressed points are allocated to the SENSE of the measurement, odd points to injection of the current. This layout is doable all the way through the switching matrix and can be joint with two wire continuity tests.\n<ul>\n \t<li>To give you an example, the continuity test in 4 wires mode lets you carry out measurements on wires of 50 cm length and 5/10 mm cross-section (between 7 and 13 mW) with good resolution.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Insulation Test:</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>The insulation test also known as high resistance test is always made DC. The insulation test is combined with a short-circuit test and high voltage test in DC.</li>\n \t<li>The insulation test combines several functions.</li>\n \t<li>The insulation test can perform:\n<ul>\n \t<li>determining insulation resistances from fifty kilo ohm to two thousand mega ohm at high voltage i.e. from 20V to 2000V.</li>\n \t<li>measurement of dielectric strength and detection of short circuits.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n \t<li>The insulation test proceeds as follows:\n<ul>\n \t<li>An initial test at low voltage (continuity measurement) to detect any short circuit (1). If a short circuit is found, the insulation test stops (the message SHORT CIRCUIT appears in the error list).</li>\n \t<li>If there is no short circuit, the high voltage is applied. During the programmable rise time (2), if breakdown occurs, the voltage is displayed and the test stops (the breakdown voltage is given in the error list).</li>\n \t<li>If no breakdown occurs and if the voltage does not reach the required value (±10%), the message U&lt;Uprog appears in the error list.</li>\n \t<li>Next, the voltage is applied for the duration of the programmed application time (3). If breakdown occurs during this period, the moment when the fault appears is displayed in the error list and the test stops.</li>\n \t<li>Lastly, if all goes well, at the end of the application time (4), the insulation test is made, and the insulation resistance measured. The tester will add a measurement time as a function of the range requested. The measurement time varies from 20ms to 240ms according to range.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n \t<li>To end the sequence, the tester reduces the high voltage and then discharges the unit tested to an earth resistance (total time 20ms).</li>\n \t<li>This procedure is identical at the end of every measurement of insulation.</li>\n \t<li>The dielectric strength test detects any sudden variation in the increase of the test current outside the programmed limit.</li>\n \t<li>The short circuit test or high voltage test can be programmed out of the test.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Phasing Test:</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>The correct phasing of all LV circuits shall be checked at all positions where the LV cables are terminated into fuse bases and where any LV cable is run from point to point.</li>\n \t<li>This test shall be performed with an instrument designed for the purpose. Mains frequency voltage of 240 Volts is not acceptable for this test.</li>\n \t<li>The neutral conductor shall be connected to the earth stake for this test.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Earth Resistance Test:</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>In any overhead or underground network, the earth resistance at any point along the length of a LV feeder is to have a maximum resistance of 10 ohms prior to connection to the existing network.</li>\n \t<li>In any overhead or underground network, the overall resistance to earth Shall be less than 1 ohm prior to connection to the existing network.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>High Voltage Test:</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>The high voltage test (also called dielectric strength test or hipot test) can be made in AC or DC. If the high voltage test is made in DC, it is then combined with insulation; if the high voltage test is made in AC, it is then, this is then, more stressful for the sample and made according to the sketch below.</li>\n \t<li>Measurement of high voltage test under alternating current is performed using an alternating voltage (50Hz) adjustable to an effective 50V to 1,500V. As is the case with direct current, the high voltage test detects any sudden rise of current up to a programmed threshold.</li>\n \t<li>The short circuit test is maintained by default. The rise time is more than 500 ms and the application time at least one period.</li>\n \t<li>Warning: The high voltage test under alternating current is penalized by the capacitive value of the tested equipment. It must be remembered that the generator power is limited to 5 mA.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Benefits of Cable Testing</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Product warranties are limited</li>\n \t<li>Testing is less expensive than repair</li>\n \t<li>Periodic testing will futureproof the infrastructure</li>\n</ul>",

The grounding system comprises of a grounding rod that connects the instrument to the earth. If ever a disastrous failure of insulation between power line and conductive parts occur, the voltage will be pushed to ground. The current that is created because of this event will flow, causing a circuit breaker to open or a fuse to blow thus avoiding a shock hazard.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nClearly, a shock hazard prevails if the earth or ground connection is intruded, either accidentally or intentionally.

The grounding system comprises of a grounding rod that connects the instrument to the earth. If ever a disastrous failure of insulation between power line and conductive parts occur, the voltage will be pushed to ground. The current that is created because of this event will flow, causing a circuit breaker to open or a fuse to blow thus avoiding a shock hazard.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nClearly, a shock hazard prevails if the earth or ground connection is intruded, either accidentally or intentionally. The possibility for a shock might be larger than assumed if there is case of leakage currents. Even in the scenario of no insulation failure, intrusion of leakage currents streaming through the grounding rod still pose a threat of electric shock to somebody meeting the ungrounded system and ground at the same time.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nThis is a huge concern when it comes to the field of medical applications, where a patient might be the receiver of the electric shock. A shock can be even fatal if the patient is weak or unconscious, or if the current flows to internal organs. The two-layered insulation offered in non-grounded equipment ensures protection. The security in this scenario is made sure because both coats of insulation are not likely to collapse together. Nevertheless, the situations that leads to leakage currents still exists and must be considered.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> </span>\n\nHence, how can you eradicate or reduce the outcomes of leakage current?
